## 1 Introduction

So you’ve decided to check out your new Mendix Community Profile page, but you've found it suspiciously empty. Don’t worry, we're here to help you set up your profile so you can show the world what a real Mendix developer looks like!

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Set up your Community Profile
* Merge your accounts
* Make your account public

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Have an account with Mendix (register [here](https://www.mendix.com/try-now/))

## 3 My Community Profile

The first thing you want to check out is the [My Community Profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/profile) page. To get there, mouse over your picture in the navigation bar and click **My Community Profile**. This overview page shows a the main page of your profile, including your summary, skills, industry experience, and badges.

When you access your profile page through the My Community Profile link, it is automatically in edit mode so that you can easily update your profile. Click ![](attachments/19202388/19399148.png) to add a summary, new skills, industry experience, and links to your social media profiles.

If you access your profile through the **Developers** or **Leaderboards** tabs of the [Our Community](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/community) page, your public profile will be displayed. Click **Edit Profile** to go into edit mode:

## 4 Merging Your Accounts

Since the release of My Community Profile you can merge your old Mendix account(s) into your current Mendix account. This action will combine all your hard-earned points, certifications and achievements in your efforts to climb the leaderboards.

How can I merge my accounts? With five quick and easy steps!

1.  Go to [your profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/ownprofile/)
2.  Make your profile public
3.  Click Account Settings
4.  Enter the email address of the account you want to merge with your current account
5.  Send merge request

We’ll take things from there and the email address of the merged account will be shown in the list when the accounts have been merged.

Note: with this action we only combine the accounts. We don’t deactivate the old account(s). This should be done by that company’s administrator.

## 5 My Work

Add your Mendix project experience on this page by clicking on New Project and filling out the form. You can add a screenshot that will be shown on the My Work page, and will be visible to other developers when they visit your Work page.
