## 1 Introduction

The documentation is open to the Mendix community, which means you can make changes and add to it in ways that you see necessary. Do you see a how-to that is inaccurate or a section of the reference guide that needs to be updated for UI changes? Now you can help us improve the documentation for the whole Mendix community!

We believe community-generated documentation can cover new areas of content and deal with the specific questions that only you know need to be answered. The documentation will address the needs of the community, and the community will play a key role in maintaining, improving, and expanding it.

All of the Mendix documentation is stored in GitHub. With a GitHub profile, you can edit all of the existing documentation. You can also write a new how-to on an awesome topic of your choice and submit it to our documentation.

To work on the documentation in GitHub, you will be using Markdown. For details on this easy-to-use syntax, see the [GitHub Guide to Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## 3 Editing the Existing Documentation

To edit the existing documentation (for example, the reference guide or a how-to), follow these steps:

1. Click **Edit on GitHub** in the upper-right corner of the specific Mendix documentation page that you want to work on.
2. Find the files in the repository and make your changes (make sure your changes align with our [Content Writing and Formatting Guidelines](Content+Writing+and+Formatting+Guidelines)).
3. Create a pull request.

## 4 Writing a New How-to

To add a new how-to to our documentation and submit it to our documentation, follow these steps:

1. Click **Write a new how-to** on the Mendix documentation homepage.
2. From the repository, save a copy of the [How-To Template](The+How+to+Template+Page) locally in order to use it.
3. Follow the guidelines in the template for writing your how-to, and make sure the text aligns with our [Content Writing and Formatting Guidelines](Content+Writing+and+Formatting+Guidelines).
4. Take screenshots for the how-to and add them to a new sub-folder in the **attachments** folder. For more details on working with images, see [5 Naming New Files and Images](#NamingNewFilesandImages).
5. To merge your new how-to files, fork the GitHub repository, and add your files.
6. Create a pull request.

You may receive a response to your pull request asking for verification of specific issues. Don’t panic! We just want to make sure your documentation submission fits well with what we have. Do your best with the request so that we can incorporate your documentation in our repository.

When writing a new how-to, make sure the Markdown file name is the same as the title of the how-to. Use a plus sign ("+") between each word of your file name (for example, "Clear+Warning+Messages").

When adding new image files, make sure the image file name describes what the image shows (meaning, labels on the UI and any specific data). Use underscores ("`_`") between each word of your image file name (for example, "New_App_Starting_Screen").

The following image file types are allowed: .jpg, .png, .gif.
