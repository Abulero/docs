## 1 Introduction

The purpose of the Partner Profile is to give the Mendix Community and customers a good and transparent overview of our partners' knowledge, skills, experience, reviews, and culture. The Partner Profile provides our partners with a simple and clear way to present themselves. it also presents an aggregated view of the developers within your organization, including the number of certified developers and their average Mendix level.

## 5 Adding Developers to Your Partner Profile

This section presents information on adding the biggest asset of your company to the Partner Profile: the employees. Before you can add a developer to the Partner Profile, make sure their profile is set to public. For details on how to set up your Community profile and set it to public, see [How to Set Up Your Community profile](how-to-set-up-your-profile).

To add developers to the Partner Profile, follow these steps, go to the **Developers** tab, which shows all the employees attached to your company:

![](attachments/19203677/20217919.png)

Developers with a public profile are shown at the top of this overview. You can use the search and filter functionalities to search for a specific team member.

<div class="alert alert-info">

Make sure you have off-boarded the developers through the company administration in the Mendix platform who are no longer working at your company. These former employees will still be visible in the overview. It is important that you deactivate these in the developers portal so that they donâ€™t have access to your Mendix projects anymore.

</div>

Select the colleagues within your organization who are currently active and whose certifications you want to count for the total by clicking **Add as developer**:

<div class="alert alert-info">

Only the certifications and Mendix levels (the exact amount of points) of the added developers will be counted in your partner profile. The highest rank of certification will be added to the overview, and the amount of points will be added to the average Mendix level of all your developers.

## 7 Partner Overview Page

The [partner overview page](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/openid/login?immediate=true&continuation=link/partneroverview) shows our partner community. The sorting is based on the combination of several KPIs:

*   Projects rating (PR): this is the average rating of all the reviews on your reference cases.
    ![](attachments/19203677/20217923.png)
*   Certified developers (CD): this shows the total amount of certified developers (note: developers with multiple certifications count as one certified developer).
     ![](attachments/19203677/20217924.png)
*   Mendix Level (ML): this is based on the average points (resulting in a [Mendix Level](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/faq)) of your developers added to your public profile.
    ![](attachments/19203677/20217925.png)

    For the calculation of the sorting order we use the average points instead of the Mendix Level, this will result in an more granulated sorting.

*   Number of reference projects (RP): the number of reference projects are also part of the sorting formula.

For the sorting we normalize the KPI's of all the partners to a score between 0 and 1, following this formula:

New KPI value = (your value - minimal value) / (maximum value - minimum value)

Example: you have 14 certified developers (CD). The biggest company has 40 certified developers (max) and smallest 1 certified developer (min):

* KPI value CD biggest company = 1
* KPI value CD smallest company = 0
* KPI value CD your company = 0,33 = (14 - 1) / (40-1)

The sum of the normalised KPI values of your company (PR+CD+ML+RP) defines the sorting order between the partners.
