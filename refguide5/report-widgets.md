With reporting you can create reports over the database data. Reporting is used for creating aggregated information, e.g. total sales per customer.

The difference between a data grid and a basic report is that the data shown in the basic report is not stored in the database. Each time a report is created the data is retrieved from the database. The user can define a wide variety of data sets over the data presented in the report pane. Like for example aggregations, filters, etc.

A report is defined in a [report pane](/refguide5/report-pane), which is inserted in a [page](/refguide5/page).

The top section of the report pane can contain parameter widgets ([drop downs](/refguide5/drop-down) and/or [date range selectors](/refguide5/date-range-selector)) through which the end user can filter the displayed data, and a [report button](/refguide5/report-button) through which the end user can start the reporting.

The bottom section of the report pane should contain one or more [report charts](/refguide5/report-chart) (to show data graphically) and/or [basic reports](/refguide5/basic-reports) (to show data in matrices) which define the reports themselves.
