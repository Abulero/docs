The snippet call widget allows you to use a [snippet](/refguide5/snippet) on another snippet, a [page](/refguide5/page) or a [layout](/refguide5/layout).

## Common Properties

### Name

The internal name of the widget. You can use this to give sensible names to widgets. The name property also appears in the generated HTML: the widget DOM element automatically includes the class '`mx-name-{NAME}`', which can be useful for [Selenium testing](/howto50/selenium-support).

## General Properties

### Snippet

The actual [Snippet](/refguide5/snippet) that will be shown here.
