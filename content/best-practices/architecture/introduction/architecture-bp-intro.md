## Introduction

Mendix is optimized for the easiest and fastest way to develop and maintain Apps that fulfil a business function. As the scope grows larger, architecture becomes more important, and it becomes
relevant to leverage best practices expertise in the area.

The Architecture Best Practices complements the sections in the Evaluation Guide: Data Management, Integration, Deployment, DevOps, Architecture and Security.

### About Architecture Best Practices

Best Practices around Architecture will be valuable for architects, designers, business developers and more technical developers that work on Mendix Projects. The Best Practices try to address common areas where we think quality of Mendix solutions can improve by reading the documents or using the examples in the App Store.
