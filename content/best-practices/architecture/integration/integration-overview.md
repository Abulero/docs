## 1 Introduction

These *Expert Best Practices for Architecture* will provide Lead Developers, Designers, and Architects with recommendations for when to choose one integration option over another. They will also present examples for integration solutions made with the Mendix Platform involved.

### 1.1 What Questions Are Addressed?

These are the questions addressed in the integration-focused *Expert Best Practices for Architecture*:

* What are good business scenarios for using Mendix?
* How do you integrate Mendix in an enterprise landscape?
* What technical and functional options are there for integration?
* How do you move towards a more microservice-oriented architecture?

To start looking at how these questions are addressed, see [Introduction to Integration](integration-intro) and [Mendix & Integration](mendix-integration), and the subesquest sections containing theoretical guidelines for a number of integration areas:

The intention is to add [Integration Examples](integration-examples) accompanied by examples in the [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/index3.html). At this time, examples for [Export, Import & Batch Processing](export-import-batch) and [Workflow Integration](workflow-integration) are available. 

## 2 How to Use the Integration Best Practices

### 2.1 Enterprise Architecture, Positioning & Project Validation

Enterprise and Domain Architects can scan these best practices for typical examples of how the Mendix Platform has been used for integration. This is useful for positioning Mendix within the enterprise and validating for which projects and roles Menidx apps may be useful. This diagram presents the basic steps of this process:

### 2.2 Solution Architecture & Project Planning

Solution Architects and Lead Developers can gain an overview of available options as well as recommendations for integration. This can lead to more realistic estimates, a better solution architecture, and hopefully more stable solutions. This diagram shows the basic steps to be expected:

### 2.3 Design & Architecture Reviews

These best practices will also help when conducting design reviews on existing solutions and evaluating ways to solve issues. This could be relevant for a legacy solution or a larger Mendix solution. Reconsidering past decisions and refactoring is part of the Agile model for achieving value quickly and making gradual improvements.

### 2.4 Services for Test & Operations

A new category of integration is growing important in the DevOps and microservices areas. This type of integration is related to building services used to automate testing or to drive a coherent operational overview and support a maintenance team.
