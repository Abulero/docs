## 1 Introduction

Best Practices for Integration will help lead developers, designers and architects to see examples for integration solutions made with Mendix involved, and some recommendation for when to choose one option over another.

### 1.1 What is the question?

The questions answered are:

1. What are good business scenarios to use Mendix?
2. How to integrate Mendix in an enterprise landscape?
4. What technical and functional options are there for integration?
3. How to move towards a more Microservice oriented architecture?

### 1.2 Integration Guidelines

These Best Practices guidelines are the more theoretical part of the best practices and they will cover the following content areas:

### 1.3 Integration Use Cases and Examples

The Best Practices for integration include [Integration Use Cases](integration-use-cases). The target is to accompany these use-cases with examples in the App Store.

Tthe typical use cases that will be described are shown in the diagram below. At this time, only use cases for [Export, Import & Batch Processing](export-import-batch) and [Workflow Integration](workflow-integration) are available.

## 2 Ways to use Best Practices on Integration

### 2.1 Enterprise Architecture, Positioning & Project Validation

Enterprise and Domain Architects can scan these Best Practices for typical use cases and examples of how Mendidx has been used. This is useful for positioning Mendix within the enterprise and validating for which projects and roles Menidx apps may be useful. This diagram presents the basic steps of this process:

### 2.2 Solution Architecture & Project Planning

Solution Architects and Lead Developers will gain an overview of the available options as well as recommendations for integration. This can lead to more realistic estimates, a better solution architecture and hopefully more stable solutions. The diagram shows the basic steps expected:

### 2.3 Design & Architecture Reviews

The Best Practices will also help when conducting design reviews on existing solutions and evaluating ways to solve issues. This scenario could apply to a legacy solution or a larger Mendix solution. Reconsidering past decisions and refactoring is part of the Agile model for achieving value quickly and making gradual improvements.

### 2.4 Services for Test & Operations

A new category of integration is growing important in the DevOps and microservices areas. This type of integration is related to building services used to automate testing or to drive a coherent operational overview and support the maintenance team.
