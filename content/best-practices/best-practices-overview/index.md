**NEEDS STAGE 4 REVIEW.**

## 1 Introduction 

Mendix is optimized for the easiest and fastest way to develop and maintain apps that fulfil a business function.

The [Mendix Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/) provides a great overview of all the possibilities and features in the Mendix Platform, and the [Mendix Reference Guide](/refguide/) explains the product in detail.

With the **Best Practices** documentation, we want to share information on how to approach typical challenges and solve specific use cases. This documentation is written by experts in the field, and sometimes it refers to real product examples available in the [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com).

While there are many ways to solve problems, we do not suggest that these are the only ways. We want to present ideas on how to realize solutions that are stable and easy to maintain in areas such as [architecture](../architecture/index), UX & design thinking, DevOps & Agile, and quality assurance.

### 1.1 About Best Practices

Best Practices will eventually be valuable for all the people that participate in the application lifecycle, from scoping and estimation to maintenance in production.

### 1.2 Planned Best Practices

These best practices will be expanded on an ongoing basis to cover the following areas:

* [Architecture](../architecture/index)
	* [Integration](../architecture/integration/integration-overview)
	* [Performance](../architecture/performance/performance-overview)
	* Microservices
	* Security
	* CI/CD & test automation
	* Monitoring & robustness
* UX & design thinking
* DevOps & Agile
* Quality assurance

### 1.3 Structure of Best Practices

For each category and sub-category of best practices, there will be an overview that covers the breadth of the area discussed. This will be followed by a number of specific areas or use cases that are covered more in detail. These will refer to more detailed information in the [Mendix Reference Guide](/refguide/) or [Mendix How-to's](/howto/) that explains the product. The best practices will sometimes include example implementations in the App Store.

## 2 Overview

### 2.1 How Are the Best Practices Created?

Mendix organizes subject matter experts from different parts of the organization into guilds. Guild members meet frequently to shares problems and ideas, research different areas, and write guidelines and best practices around a subject area.

At this point in Mendix, there is an Architecture Guild and a UX Guild, and there is a plan for a DevOps Guild and a Quality Assurance Guild.

Members of these guilds own the content of the best practices. They also own the Best Practices items in the App Store, which are examples of the best ways to implement certain solutions for certain use cases.

### 2.2 Are These "Best Practices" or "Good Practices"?

This type of documentation could have been called "good practices," because there is no guarantee that there is not an even better way to solve a specific use case. This documentation simply covers the best way that an experienced Mendix employee in that area knows how to accomplish something. In addition, each best practice is reviewed by someone else in the respective guild.

### 2.3 How Can These Best Practices Help Me?

If you are relatively new to an area covered by the best practices, the overview document should quickly bring you up to speed with the most important considerations. The overview documents will also help experienced users verify that they have considered the context while providing ideas on how to plan work.

The detailed description and use cases are intended for semi-experienced users who have already worked in a respective area so that they can compare against how a Mendix expert sees a specific use case.

A use case is intended to be business-oriented, so it can be solved in many ways. Each Mendix best-practice use case quickly lists the different ways to solve the case, and then it suggests in detail the best way to implement the solution, often while using an example in the App Store.

Some use cases will refer to examples in the App Store. These App Store items are not finished products, instead serving as small reference implementations that solve a single business problem. You can view these as examples for picking up ideas, or you can copy parts of them as starting points for building robust solutions with good error handling.

### 2.4 The Mendix Community& Knowledge Sharing

There is a great community around Mendix that constantly shares ideas, best practices, and solutions via the [Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz), [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Mendix-Netherlands/), partner presentations, and the [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com).

Partners, customers, and other developers also share a large amount of valuable Mendix modules and components via the [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/).

This culture of sharing and learning is at the heart of what Mendix believes in: helping each other delivery the best possible value to customers.

These best practices are a valuable addition to this activity, as the information and implementations will come directly from Mendix experts in their respective guilds.

### 2.5 Can I Create Best Practices?

As part of the guild culture, we stimulate creative discussions that lead teams and stakeholderss forward.

As best practices are published, we hope to get feedback and ideas related to the material. If the feedback case is strong and time allows, there will be updates and improvements done by the topic authors.

We will reserve the App Store **Best Practices** category for examples that have been created inside Mendix. This means that you know these App Store items are coming directly  from Mendix and they will be kept up to date.

### 2.6 What's Next?

Creating thorough documents and examples takes time, and the best practices will be built up gradually over time.

We hope these best practices will complement the existing documentation. We will try to avoid overlap by referring to existing documentation where possible.
