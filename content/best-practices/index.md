{{% todo %}}[**These cards do not reflect the currently published or planned content. It is the policy of the Documentation Team not to advertise future documentation/products (which should be done in Marketing content or blog posts). This helps to avoid dependencies and reinforce our documentation of the actual product in an accurate and transparent way. We should thus discuss removing the "Coming soon!" cards. Because when is "soon"?**]{{% /todo %}}

{{% todo %}}[**We should consider publishing the "Best Practices Overview" content on this page instead of the cards altogether. That is a more logical choice for content on this page and fits with the rest of our documentation system. It would also avoid the need for "Coming soon!"**]{{% /todo %}}
