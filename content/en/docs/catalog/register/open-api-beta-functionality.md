## 1 Introduction

We are excited to introduce our OpenAPI Beta functionality, designed to enhance your experience with Mendix applications deployed on MxCloud. This feature automatically registers all your OpenAPI and OData APIs in the Catalog, making them easily discoverable within your organization.

## 2 How to Get Your APIs Registered?

For OpenAPI, ensure you are using Mendix Studio Pro v10.0 or higher.
For OData, make sure you are using Mendix Studio Pro 8.14 or higher.
If your APIs are not hosted on MxCloud, explore alternative methods to register them [here](/catalog/register/).

## 3 Who Can Discover Your APIs?

Once your APIs are registered in the Catalog, they become discoverable to other Mendix platform users within your organization. You can manage API discoverability on a per-API basis, either from the curation pages or the API detail page. For more information, refer to our documentation [here](/catalog/manage/curate/#61-discoverable).

## 4 What Does “Beta” Mean?

Please note that this feature is currently in beta, which means we are actively testing and improving it to better meet your needs. We value your feedback, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts with us [here](https://forum.mendix.com/link/space/catalog).
