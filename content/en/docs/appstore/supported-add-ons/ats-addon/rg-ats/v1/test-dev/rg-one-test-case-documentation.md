You can export the structure of your test case by pressing **PDF**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/supported-add-ons/ats/rg-ats/v1/test-dev/rg-one-test-case-documentation/exportbutton.png" alt="PDF export button" >}}

This will generate a detailed test case documentation with all the test steps in order along with their input values.

The generated PDF document will look similar to this:
