## 1 Introduction

The Mendix Marketplace is at the heart of the Mendix developer community, which is made up of over 175,000 developers. By providing everything from simple widgets to templatized solutions, the Marketplace has the resources you need to build innovative solutions. You can browse all the content in the Mendix Marketplace, get what you need to kick start your development, and share the content you have created, which includes your commercial offerings. 

A robust ecosystem is crucial to supporting the flow of value to Mendix Makers, and Mendix Partners are at the core of that ecosystem. We want you to be a part of the Mendix Marketplace so you can help other Makers see what is possible.

Whether you are an established ISV, an ambitious startup, or a pioneering independent developer, by [sharing](/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/) your content in the Mendix Marketplace, you will create customer value by fueling the resource library for Mendix developers.
