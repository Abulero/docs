## 1 Introduction

[Amazon Rekognition](#needs-url) offers pre-trained and customizable computer vision (CV) capabilities to extract information and insights from your images.

### 1.1 Features

This connector can be used when you need to extract information from images and photos like where faces are located within an image. This module also supports features like:

- Identify if a person on an image is wearing protective equipment
- Where labels are located within an image
- Comparing faces from two different images
- Identify custom labels like your logo in images

### 1.2 Prerequisite

This module requires the [Amazon Authentication V2](#needs-url) Connector from the Marketplace (to be released)

## 2 Configuration

### 2.1 Entities

The entity includes a confidence and value, the confidence is level of confidence of the prediction and the value is the predicted gender of the face. Amazon Rekognition makes gender binary (male/female) predictions based on the physical appearance of a face in a particular image. This kind of prediction is not designed to categorize a personâ€™s gender identity, and you shouldn't use Amazon Rekognition to make such a determination. For example, a male actor wearing a long-haired wig and earrings for a role might be predicted as female. Using Amazon Rekognition to make gender binary predictions is best suited for use cases where aggregate gender distribution statistics need to be analyzed without identifying specific users. For example, the percentage of female users compared to male users on a social media platform. We don't recommend using gender binary predictions to make decisions that impact an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services. |

The left (x-coordinate) and top (y-coordinate) are coordinates representing the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0). The top and left values returned are ratios of the overall image size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API returns a left value of 0.5 (350/700) and a top value of 0.25 (50/200). The width and height values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image dimension. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.
