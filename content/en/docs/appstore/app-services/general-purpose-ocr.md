### 2.2 Installing the Component in Your App

To download and install the General Purpose OCR app service in your app, follow the instructions in the [Importing Content from the App Explorer](/appstore/general/app-store-content/#import) section in *Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro*. After the app service is installed, you can see it in the **App Explorer** and also in the **Document Data Capture Service** category in the **Toolbox**.

## 3 Configuration

### 3.1 Domain Model

This section describes how data are stored in the pre-configured domain model, which is included in this module.

Below is a sample document:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/general-purpose-ocr/sample-document.png" >}}

Below is the pre-configured domain model, which can be used for extracted data:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/general-purpose-ocr/domain-model.png" >}}

The **ExtractionResponse** entity will be created automatically for storing the response from the backend API call. The **ExtractionResponse** entity has the **Status** attribute, which indicates the status of the extraction. The value of the **Status** can be **IN_PROGRESS**, **COMPLETED**, or **FAILED**. The **ExtractionResponse** entity is associated with the **Output** entity.

The **Output** entity is further divided into two domains **Aborted** and **Extracted**.

Documents which are not successfully extracted in the backend API call due to errors or exceptions are stored inside the **AbortedDocument** entity. The **AbortedDocument** entity stores the **DocumentId** attribute and the **Name** attribute of the corresponding aborted documents.

Documents which are successfully extracted in the backend API call are stored inside the **ExtractedDocument** entity. The **ExtractedDocument** entity contains the **DocumentID** attribute and the **Name** attribute of the corresponding documents, and is associated with the **Content** entity.

The **Content** entity is in the XML format. 

A document can have multiple pages, so there is a **Page** entity. A page can contain multiple blocks, so there is a **Block** entity, which has a **BlockType** attribute. The **BlockType** attribute can have one of these three values: **Text**, **Table**, and **Barcode**. The document is further divided based on the value of **BlockType**.

If the block is text or a barcode, it is associated with a **Text** entity, which is associated with a **Paragraph** entity. A paragraph can have multiple lines, so the **Paragraph** entity has a **LineContent** attribute.

If the block is a table,  it is associated with a **Row** entity, as a table can be divided multiple rows. A row can have multiple cells and text, so there is a **CellText** entity. A cell can contain multiple paragraphs, so there is **CellParagraph** entity. A paragraph can have multiple lines, so **CellParagraph** entity has a **LineContent** attribute. The **LineContent** attribute contains the actual data.

### 3.2 Configuring the Binding Keys {#configure-keys}

Before you deploy an app, you should configure the binding keys in your app as follows:

1.  In the **App Explorer** or the **Project Explorer**, go to **GeneralPurposeOCR** > **Configurations**. **Access_Key** and **Secret_Key** are defined as constants.

2. Double-click the constant for each constant, enter the key you saved and click **OK** to save the changes.

## 4 Usage

To use the General Purpose OCR, first create an [import mapping](/refguide/import-mappings/) that defines how to map extracted data from documents to an entity, and then include the General Purpose OCR or the General Purpose OCR in Background activity in a microflow. This microflow should be set up to accept your input documents, extract data from the documents in bulk, and then map the data to an entity using the import mapping that you created.

### 4.1 Extracting Data

To extract the data, perform the following steps:

1. In the **Toolbox**, drag the **General Purpose OCR** activity or the **General Purpose OCR in Background** activity from the **Document Data Capture Service** category into your microflow. Which activity to use here depends on your needs:

   * The **General Purpose OCR** activity has a synchronous behaviour, which directly gets the extraction result in the response

       {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/general-purpose-ocr/microflow-gpo.png" >}}

   *  The **General Purpose OCR  In Background** activity has an asynchronous behaviour, which provides a microflow that further takes the response of the data extraction results as a parameter and will use the results further

       {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/general-purpose-ocr/microflow-gpo-in-background.png" >}}

2. Create a list of documents that inherits from `System.FileDocument`. Documents from which data are extracted should be passed as a list, as shown in the microflows above.

3. Double-click the **General Purpose OCR** activity or the **General Purpose OCR in Background** activity to open the dialog box.

4.  Follow the corresponding procedure to configure the settings of the activity:

    * [Configure the General Purpose OCR activity](#general-purpose-ocr-activity)
    * [Configure the General Purpose OCR in Background activity](#general-purpose-ocr-in-background-activity)

#### 4.1.1 Configuring the General Purpose OCR Activity (Synchronous Behavior) {#general-purpose-ocr-in-background-activity}

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/general-purpose-ocr/general-purpose-ocr-sync.png" >}}

To configure the activity, perform the following steps:

1. For **Document List**, click **Edit** and select the **Document List** which inherits from `System.FileDocument`. 
2. For **Use return value**, if you want to use the response results, select **Yes**; otherwise, select **No**. The Boolean value indicates whether you accept or decline the request for data extraction.
3.  For **Object name**, enter the response object of the **ExtractionResponse** entity. You need to check the **Status** attribute of this entity, and based on its value, retrieve the extraction results from the associated entities. Possible values of **Status** are as follows:
   
    - **IN_PROGRESS**
    - **COMPLETED**
    - **FAILED**

4. Click **OK** to save the changes.

#### 4.1.2 Configuring the General Purpose OCR In Background Activity (Asynchronous Behavior){#general-purpose-ocr-in-background-activity}

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/general-purpose-ocr/general-purpose-ocr-in-background.png" >}}

To configure the activity, perform the following steps:

1. For **Document List**, click **Edit** and select the **Document List** which inherits from `System.FileDocument`.
2.  For **Extraction Result Microflow**, click **Select** and select the **Microflow** that you created to takesthe response of the data extraction results.

    {{% alert type="info" %}}This microflow will be called internally from the java action once the extraction result is received from backend, and this extraction result will be passed as a parameter to this selected microflow.{{% /alert %}}

3. For **Microflow Input Parameter**, click **Edit** and enter a string as the name of the input parameter for the microflow. This should be the name of the parameter of the object from **GPO.ExtractionResponse** used in the microflow that you set for **Extraction Result Microflow**.
4. For **Use return value**, if you want to use the response results, select **Yes**; otherwise, select **No**. The Boolean value indicates whether you accept or decline the request for data extraction.
5. For **Variable name**, enter **ReturnValueName**.
6. Click **OK** to save the changes.
