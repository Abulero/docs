## 1 Introduction

{{% todo %}}[Verify Marketplace Docs tabs]{{% /todo %}}

The [Microsoft Teams Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/118391) app service enables sending messages to a Microsoft Teams channel automatically. You can add and configure the app service in a microflow. Once the microflow that uses the app service is triggered, your app asynchronously sends out the message to the Microsoft Teams channel. 

This app service is an [add-on module](/refguide/consume-add-on-modules-and-solutions/).


### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

* Send messages to pre-configured channels in Microsoft Teams

* Let your Mendix app send an automated notification to a pre-configured channel, when an event occurs in your Mendix application (for example, your Mendix app can automatically send a message to a pre-configured channel whenever a ticket is raised on the support portal application)

* Let your Mendix app send an automated message to a pre-configured channel to trigger users to perform an action (for example, your Mendix app can automatically ask users to create a Jira ticket by sending them a message in a pre-configured channel)

### 1.2 Features

* Send HTML, markdown, or plain text messages
* Send Microsoft Teams actionable message sards

### 1.3 Prerequisites

* Your organization should allow you to use Webhooks in Microsoft Teams
* The app service can only be used with Studio Pro 9 versions starting from [9.10](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.10/)

     {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/webhook-data-view.png" >}}
     
     The system automatically generates a unique **Webhook ID** for each **Webhook URL** you add. You will need to give **Webhook ID** as input to the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity to send messages. 
     
     {{% alert type="info" %}}Each **Webhook URL** you add is counted as utilization towards the allocated app service quota. If a **Webhook URL** is incorrect, you can edit or delete the Webhook.{{% /alert %}}     
    
12.  Copy the **Webhook ID** as follows:
     1.  Hover over the **...** icon in the **Action** column to open the pop-up menu.

         {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/copied-popup.png" >}}
        
         {{% alert type="note" %}}You can select **Edit** or **Delete** to edit or delete a Webhook.{{% /alert %}}

### 4.2 Sending Message to a Teams Channel

#### 4.2.1 Using Microflow

You can use the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity in a microflow to send messages to a Teams channel:

1.  From the toolbox, drag and drop the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity into your microflow.
    
    The following representative microflow contains activities with the required attributes, the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity, and a placeholder to capture the returned object.
    
    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/connector-in-microflow.png" >}}
    
2. Double-click the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity to open the **Microsoft Teams Connector** dialog box.

3.  Specify the following settings with expression syntax:
    1. Set the **webhookId** parameter to the **Webhook ID** generated in the Communication Services Console.
    2.  For **Message type**, select **Text** or **Card** from the drop-down list:
        
        *  If you want to send message as plain text or in HTML or markdown formatting, select **Text**
        
            {{% alert type="info" %}}Fore more information about HTML and markdown tags supported by Microsoft Teams, see [*Format Cards in Microsoft Teams*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format).{{% /alert %}}
          
        * If you want to use a actionable message card as message, select **Card**
        
            {{% alert type="info" %}}Fore more information about message cards, see [Building a Message Card](#build-message-card).{{% /alert %}}
       
    3.  For the **Message** parameter, set up the message content in the String format. Below is an example:
       
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/html-message.png" >}}
        The example above will render in the Microsoft Teams channel like this:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/html-output.png" >}}
       
    4. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}All parameters are mandatory. Setting any value to be empty or **none** will cause an error.{{% /alert %}}

After the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity is configured, once the microflow that uses this activity is triggered, the app asynchronously sends out the message to the Microsoft Teams channel. When the message is sent successfully, the activity returns a **SendMessageReponse** object. The **SendMessageReponse** entity for this object comes with the module and is predefined:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/send-message-response-entity.png" >}}

* If the message is successfully sent, the value of the `SentMessage` attribute is `true`
* If the message could not be sent, the value of the `SentMessage` attribute is `false`
* The `Message` attribute contains the respective response message

#### 4.2.2 Building a Message Card {#build-message-card}

Microsoft Teams support [actionable message cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference). You can build a message card and send it to a Microsoft Teams channel using the Microsoft Teams connector. To build a message card, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the [Card Playground](https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net/). This playground contains sample message cards. You can modify the JSON for any sample message card and view the corresponding generated message card on the fly.

2.  Edit a message card sample as follows:

    1. At the upper-right corner of the page, click **Select Sample** to open the drop-down list. 
    2.  Below the **Legacy MesssageCard samples** category, select a sample message card.
        {{% alert type="info" %}}Do not select any sample card above the **Legcy MessageCard sample**. They are adaptive cards, which do not work with the Microsoft Teams connector.{{% /alert %}}
    
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/sample-message-cards.png" >}}
    
    3.  Edit the sample message card. The preview of your message card is on the right side of the page. 
    
        Below is the basic structure of a message card and the corresponding fields in JSON:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/card-json-structure.png" >}}
       
        The example above with **Add a comment action** expanded looks like this:
       
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/add-a-comment-expanded.png" >}}

        {{% alert type="info" %}}For more information about the design of a message card, see [*Design guidelines*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference#design-guidelines). {{% /alert %}}

## 5 Checking Statistics Using the Usage Dashboard {#statistics}
