# Overview/Description

This module can be used to build a Mendix app that acts as an IDP towards other applications, hence contributing to a Single Sign-On experience for the endusers of those applications. Other apps can delegate user authentication (login) to the app you would be building using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.

It supports responsive browser based applications and has been tested with applications that use the OIDC SSO module. This module can be used in Mendix 9( 9.12.5) or higher.

# Documentation
## Description

OpenID Connect(OIDC) Provider works as an Identity provider(IDP) which uses OIDC protocol to login into Mendix app with the help of OIDC Client. It works with web/responsive applications.

What this means is that you can set up a single Mendix app which uses the [OIDC SSO module](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120371) to allow end-users to be authenticated by your central IdP. This app also acts as an OIDC client for your other apps to use through OIDC SSO. Using an API, apps can easily be added or removed from the provider within the Mendix ecosystem without the app and relevant user roles having to be added to your central IdP. However, you retain all the benefits of your central IdP in controlling on- and offboarding of users.



## Typical usage scenarios


![User-uploaded image: image.png](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_7FA3DFDDF1768422344AC9AA4AEF60E5D60D38EEA777418E652E6EA98AFA6080_1626373468474_image.png)



- Mendix customers that want to build an IAM Broker solution that would ‘hide’ a multitude of Mendix apps from their corporate IDP.  By having those apps delegate authentication to the broker and have the broker delegate authentication to their IDP, only one OAuth client needs to be configured at their IDP.  A deployment pipeline can register additional Mendix apps at the IAM Broker in an automated fashion via API. 
- In a similar fashion, Mendix Solution Vendors (MSVs) may want to hide the microservice architecture of their solution from the customer by using the IAM Broker as a single IAM integration point for their customers.
## Features and limitations

Features

- Supports responsive web applications, using the common OAuth Authorisation Code grant.
- Your apps can be registered as OAuth client at the OIDC Provider via client registration API or client configuration screen.
- It publishes a well-known endpoint to communicate endpoints and other IDP characteristics to client applications.
- Clients need to validate ID-tokens that they receive and can retrieve the necessary keys from the well known endpoint exposed by the OIDC Provider module.
- Various security features are supported: OIDC ‘nonce’ parameter, PKCE support and multiple client authentication methods ( client_secret_post, client_secret_basic)
- Supports front channel and back-channel logout as public beta features.
    

Limitations

- The hybrid and client credential grants are not supported, although the OIDC Provider may contain some (rudimentary) implementation to support them.
- The current implementation is an early beta release.
## Known Issues

Bug: -

- Custom claims not working properly.
    When we add a custom claim in OIDC Provider, it will be included in IDToken which will be generated by OIDC Provider. 
    The value we are currently getting is `"preferred_username2": "scala.concurrent.impl.FutureConvertersImpl$CF@6c163285[Completed normally]"`   instead of
    "preferred_username2": sharishma

## Configuration overview

**OIDC Provider(this app) configuration**

- Run the application and login as administrator
- Create test users in Administration-> Accounts
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A27DA9F06997C3D919A20D2E1F62DBDD4D4A86848C0F5AA1A9B4E4528436EC3B_1660493573415_file.png)

- Now move to OpenIDConnect configuration page. Create a new key on the ‘Server Keys’ tab 
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A27DA9F06997C3D919A20D2E1F62DBDD4D4A86848C0F5AA1A9B4E4528436EC3B_1660493638675_file.png)

- 12. Create a scope under scopes section: new ->openid (standard) 
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A27DA9F06997C3D919A20D2E1F62DBDD4D4A86848C0F5AA1A9B4E4528436EC3B_1660493638683_file.png)

- There are two ways to create client in OIDC provider: Clients -> New Client Registration 
    - **automat****ed** ******client** **registration** **via API** 
        You can do this from a deployment pipeline. You can test this possibility by using postman. The OIDC Server module generates a client registration access token that you need to use the API.

    - **manual registration** **via Configuration screen**  
        It is used when you want to test the app with OIDC client 
        Clients -> New Client Registration 
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A27DA9F06997C3D919A20D2E1F62DBDD4D4A86848C0F5AA1A9B4E4528436EC3B_1660493638697_file.png)

        Add ClientID, Client Secret, redirect URL 
        You can enable PKCE in OIDC client and server to use PKCE feature
        
        Details which can be configured on the provider end -  
        **Client secret**- c46591bd-8fae-4f90-9efb-b5973bea04df 
        **Client ID**- DemoClient 
        **post redirect URL**- [http://localhost:8081/logout](http://localhost:8081/logout) 
        During development and testing, you can use the local host port number according to your case. Example: If your OIDC client app port is 8080 then use http://localhost:8080/logout and if your OIDC client port is 8081 then use http://localhost:8081/logout. It is 8081 in my case. 
        **redirect URL**- [http://localhost:8081/oauth/v2/callback](http://localhost:8081/oauth/v2/callback) 
        During development and testing, you can use the local host port number according to your case. Example: If your OIDC client app port is 8080 then use http://localhost:8080/oauth/v2/callback and if your OIDC client port is 8081 then use [http://localhost:8081/oauth/v2/callback](http://localhost:8081/oauth/v2/callback). It is 8081 in my case. 

**OIDC Client configuration**
This section describes configuration steps a low-code developer needs to do to run and test the interaction between his ‘IDP-app’ and his ‘client app’ using OIDC SSO module.

- Open OIDC Client in Mendix Studio pro. Change the local host port number as OpenIDConnectProvider runs on 8080.

## Troubleshooting

**Infinite loop of redirects**
The OIDC provider module sets a cookie as a means to persist the session in the user’s browser. If the cookie is not properly set, this may lead to problems. For example, when the OIDC Provider module is used to build an IAM Broker, no session is established and the broker may initiate a new session at the upstream IDP, which results in an ‘infinite loop’ of redirects via the user’s browser.
To ensure the cookie is properly set, the runtime setting com.mendix.core.SameSiteCookies must have value None. See [Environment Details](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#4222-applying-a-different-samesite-setting) for more information how to set the correct value for SameSite runtime setting. Note that the default value for this setting has changed, see [Release Notes](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.11/).
