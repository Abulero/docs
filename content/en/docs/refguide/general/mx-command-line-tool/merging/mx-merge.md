The mx merge command performs a three-way merge of two MPR files having a common base commit.

The input is three MPR files: base, mine, and theirs

## 1 Usage

Use the following command pattern for `mx merge`:

`mx merge [OPTIONS] BASE MINE THEIRS`

The `OPTIONS` are described in the table below:

| Option   | Shortcut | Result                            |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--help` | `-h`     | Displays the help text and exits. |

`BASE` is common base commit.

`MINE` is the version to merge into; this MPR contains the results of the merge.

`THEIRS` is the version to merge changes from.

## 2 Conflicts

If there are conflicts during the merge, you have to resolve those by opening the app in Studio Pro.

## 3 Examples

`mx merge C:\MyApp\MyApp.mpr C:\MyApp-main\MyApp.mpr C:\MyApp-FeatureBranch\MyApp.mpr`
