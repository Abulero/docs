# 1 Introduction

Guides in this section will help you implement key features of Native Apps and/or Progressive Web Apps.

* [Offline-First Data](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/offlinefirst-data/): Native and Progressive Web Apps use an offline database and a synchronization mechanism to replicate data on the client for efficient access and offline capabilities.
* [Deep Links](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/deep-links/): Native Apps can define a custom URL Scheme (for instance, `my-app://`) that allows other apps to access pages and functionalities of the app.
* [Location & Maps](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/location-&-maps/): Native Apps can access the user location and display native maps inside the application.
* [Push Notifications](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/push-notifications/): Native Apps can present a notification to the user that is triggered by the runtime even if the app is not running.
* [Local Notifications](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/location-&-maps/): In addition to Push Notifications, Native Aps can schedule notifications to be shown at a specific time even if the app is not running.
