## 1 Introduction

With Mendix, you can use just one platform which supports various styles of mobile app development (native, web, PWA) for multiple devices. Mendix also provides common mobile back-end services.

Mendix allows you to quickly build true [native mobile apps](/refguide/native-mobile/) and [progressive web apps](/refguide/progressive-web-app/). This document gives an overview of mobile app development with Mendix. 

With Mendix, you can create different channels (for example, responsive, native phone) from a single model using navigation profiles. These mobile profiles can be added and removed separately. If you add a profile, you must also provide a home page for it. For more information on navigation profiles, see [Navigation](/refguide/navigation/).
