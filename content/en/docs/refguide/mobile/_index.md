## 1 Introduction

With Mendix, you can use just one platform which supports various styles of mobile app development (native, web, PWA) for multiple devices. Mendix also provides common mobile back-end services.

Mendix allows you to quickly build true [native mobile apps](/refguide/native-mobile/) and [progressive web apps](/refguide/progressive-web-app/). This document gives an overview of mobile app development with Mendix. 

With Mendix, you can create different channels (for example, responsive, native phone) from a single model using navigation profiles. These mobile profiles can be added and removed separately. If you add a profile, you must also provide a home page for it. For more information on navigation profiles, see [Navigation](/refguide/navigation/). 

## 2 Getting Started with Mobile

As you begin mobile development with Mendix, our [Getting Started with Mobile](/refguide/mobile/getting-started-with-mobile/) guide can help you learn the basics. This simple guide will teach you to create a native mobile Mendix app. After you create it, you will view your app on a mobile device using our [Make It Native](/releasenotes/mobile/make-it-native-parent/) testing app. Getting Started with Mobile is a lean guide designed to show the basics of mobile development.

For a broader introduction to Mendix development, you may also use the [Quickstart](/refguide/quickstart-guide/) guide to learn some Studio Pro fundamentals:
* Learn Mendix Studio Pro's UI 
* Make a web app that uses the Domain Model, dynamic data, and handles logic with a microflow
* Add a native mobile navigation profile to your web app
* Give your native app the ability to take pictures and upload them to a database, then test it with the Make it Native app
