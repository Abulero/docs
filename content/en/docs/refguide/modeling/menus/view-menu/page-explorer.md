## 1 Introduction

The **Page Explorer** shows the structure of your page as a tree view:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/menus/view-menu/page-explorer.png" >}}

This simplified page view makes the page building experience with [Design Mode](/refguide/page/#design-mode) more powerful, as it allows to view and edit nested containers which are hard to see and select in the WYSIWYG editor. However, it can be used in combination with [Structure Mode](/refguide/page/#structure-mode) as well, e.g. to get a quick overview of the page.

## 2 Capabilities

The **Page Explorer** gives you a quick and clear overview of the page structure. Next to that, it has the following capabilities:
* add or move widgets via drag & drop
* copy, paste, and delete widgets
* open widget properties (double-click)
* same context menu as the page editor, with the additional option to add widgets/building blocks
* expand/collapse structure widgets to focus on one area of the page structure
