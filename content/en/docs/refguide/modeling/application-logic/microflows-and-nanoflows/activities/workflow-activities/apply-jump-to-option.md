This activity can only be used in **Microflows**.

This activity was introduced in Studio Pro [9.17.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.17).

## 1 Introduction

The **Apply Jump-To Option** activity allows you to apply a selected workflow activity as jump-to target. This option can be selected from a list of possible jump-to targets generated by the [generate jump-to options](/refguide/generate-jump-to-options/) activity. This is useful when, for example, you have an incompatible workflow and would like to select a specific workflow activity where the workflow should continue its execution from.
