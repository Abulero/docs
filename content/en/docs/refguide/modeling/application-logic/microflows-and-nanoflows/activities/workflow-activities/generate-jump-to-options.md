This activity can only be used in **Microflows**.

This activity was introduced in Studio Pro [9.17.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.17).

## 1 Introduction

The **Generate Jump-To Options** activity allows you to generate a list of workflow activities which can be selected as a target to ad-hoc jump to. The [apply jump-to option](/refguide/apply-jump-to-option/) activity should be used to apply the selected target activity in order to let the workflow continue from the selected activity. This is useful when, for example, you have an incompatible workflow and would like to select a specific activity where the workflow should continue its execution from.

{{% alert color="warning" %}} The list of generated options will only contain activities of the currently executed path in the workflow, excluding activities inside a [Parallel split](/refguide/parallel-split/) activity. Additionally, when the workflow is executing a branch in a [Parallel split](/refguide/parallel-split/) activity, the generated options will only contain activities inside that branch. {{% /alert %}}
