{{% alert color="info" %}}[Machine learning model](/refguide/machine-learning-kit/) support is currently in [Beta](/releasenotes/beta-features/), and is available in Studio Pro [9.23](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/) and above.{{% /alert %}}

## 1 Introduction

Studio Pro [9.23](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/) and above supports machine learning (ML) model integration in Mendix apps. Collectively called the *Machine Learning (ML) Kit*, this functionality allows Mendix developers to deploy a ML model built using common ML framework and language into Mendix Studio Pro runtime.

Design patterns are implementation patterns for machine learning models. The documents in this section include ideas, guidance, and specifications when using specific patterns with *ML Kit*.

For detailed information on working with machine learning models in Studio Pro, see [Integrate Machine Learning Models](/refguide/machine-learning-kit/).
