## 1 Introduction

Studio Pro [9.18](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.18/) and above integrates with Mendix Business Events module functionality. With the [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/modules/business-events/) module, applications can signal when something important happens, and can independently subscribe to these events if they want to be informed. Business events are like a mailing list to share event notifications between apps.

You must have the [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/modules/business-events/) module installed for it to work properly. If it is not installed, you will be prompted to download it and add it to your app.
