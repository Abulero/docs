## 1 Introduction

Data Hub Catalog is an open, standards-based metadata repository that enables Mendix developers and business admins to discover and explore data resources throughout their connected ecosystem. 

This respository is accessible to [authorized users](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/manage-data-sources/user-roles/) in your company on the web app, hub.mendix.com, or the [Data Hub APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/data-hub-apis/).

## 2 Getting Your Catalog

If you have a Mendix license and a Data Hub license, you have a Data Hub Catalog. Log in with your company credentials on hub.mendix.com to see what data sources have been shared in your company. If you don't see anything, then you can start registering services that can be shared and used!

Using your company's Catalog depends on your deployment method:

* [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/)
* [Private Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/)
* [On-Premises](/developerportal/deploy/on-premises-design/)
