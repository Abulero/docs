## 1 Introduction

The Data Hub Catalog is a catalog of OData services exposing datasets that you can use in your apps. In Mendix Studio Pro, these exposed datasets are added as *external entities* through the [Data Hub pane](/refguide/data-hub-pane/). 

## Get Your Own Catalog

Using the Data Hub Catalog depends on your deployment method.
