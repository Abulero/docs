## 1 Introduction

Data Hub Catalog is an open, standards-based metadata repository that enables Mendix developers and business admins to discover and explore data sources throughout their connected ecosystem. 

This respository is accessible to [authorized users](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/manage-data-sources/user-roles/) in your company on the web app, hub.mendix.com, or through [Data Hub APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/data-hub-apis/).

## 2 Your Company's Catalog

If you have a Mendix license and a Data Hub license, you have a Data Hub Catalog! Log in with your company credentials on hub.mendix.com to see what data sources have been shared in your company. 

Depending on your [user role](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/manage-data-sources/user-roles/) and use case, you can do the following:

* [Register data sources](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/register-data-sources/) to be used in other apps in your company
* [Consume data sources](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/consume-data-sources/) in your company's Catalog
* [Manage data sources](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/manage-data-sources/) as a data source owner or as an administrator
