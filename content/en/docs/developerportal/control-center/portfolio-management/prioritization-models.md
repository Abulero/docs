## 1 Introduction

## 2 WSJF {#wsjf}

Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is a model that can help you prioritize a list of projects. Each project's score is calculated as the the cost of delay (CoD) divided by the job size or the duration of the job. For example, if a feature would be worth €200,000 per month, and there was a delay of four months, then the total CoD should be €800,000.

If a project can deliver the most CoD within the shortest duration, it has the highest WSJF score, and provides the best economic return.

### 2.1 Calculating CoD

The CoD can be calculated using three primary components:

* User-business value – 
* Time criticality – 
* Risk reduction –

### 2.2 Calculating Job Duration



## 3 RICE {#rice}

Reach Impact Confident Effort (RICE) is a prioritization framework for quantifying the potential value of projects. You get each project's score by multiplying the Reach, Impact, and Confidence estimates, and then dividing the product by the Effort estimate.
