## 1 Introduction

## 2 WSJF {#wsjf}

Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is a model that can help you prioritize a list of projects. Each project's score is calculated as the the cost of delay (CoD) divided by the job size or the duration of the job.

## 3 RICE {#rice}

Reach Impact Confident Effort (RICE) is a prioritization framework for quantifying the potential value of projects. You get each project's score by multiplying the Reach, Impact, and Confidence estimates, and then dividing the product by the Effort estimate.
