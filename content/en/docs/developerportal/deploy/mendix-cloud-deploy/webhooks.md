## 1 Introduction

Webhooks in the Developer Portal allow you to send information about your Mendix app to an external app or workflow. This can be used, for example, to trigger an automated CI/CD workflow when a new change is committed to the Team Server.

Mendix provides webhooks to send project information when the following events happen to your app:

* On package upload – when a deployment package is uploaded to the Developer Portal
* Team Server push – when a new commit is pushed to the Team Server — this will only be triggered if your app is stored in a Git repository

## 2 Configuring a Webhook{#setting-up}

### 2.1 Creating a New Webhook

To set up a webhook, do the following:

1. Open your app in the Developer Portal.
1. Open the **Webhooks** page from the left-hand menu.

    You will see any current webhooks with an indication of whether they are active or inactive. An inactive webhook will not send any payloads to the endpoint.

1. Click **New Webhook**.
1. Enter the following information:
    * **Webhook Name** – a name, so you can identify the webhook
    * **URL** – the endpoint which will receive the information which is posted
    * **Validation Secret** – a secret which will be received by the endpoint to confirm that it has been triggered by this webhook
    * **Available Events** – the event or events which will trigger the webhook to send information to the endpoint. You can see more information about these events in the sections below.
    * **Custom Headers** – a **Key**/**Value** pair which is sent as an HTTP header to the endpoint.

You can edit or delete an existing webhook by clicking the elipsis, **…**, in the **Action** column for the webhook you want to change and then select **Edit Webhook** or **Delete Webhook**.

### 2.2 Editing an Existing Webhook

If you select **Edit Webhook** from the elipsis, **…**, in the **Action** column for a webhook you want to change, you have the following actions available to you:

* You can update **Webhook Name**, **URL**, and **Validation Secret** — click **Save** to save the changes.
* You can add or delete **Custom Headers** — click **Save** to save the changes.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}You cannot change the value of an existing custom header. If you want to change the value, delete the existing header and add a new one with the same key.{{% /alert %}}

* Click **Test Webhook** to send a test payload to the endpoint specified under **URL**.
* Click **(De)activate Webhook** to switch deactivate an active webhook or activate an inactive webhook.
* Click **Delete Webhook*** to completely remove the webhook.


## 3 Webhook Headers

Every POST payload contains the following delivery information as part of the header:

* **connection** – `close`, indicating that there is no further information for this HTTP request
* **content-length** – the size of the HTTP request in bytes, for example `475`
* **webhook-signature** – the signature of the webhook in the format `<version>,<signature>`, for example `v1,Ay2spGBdE7i6OzNkFgTDnGfqgZT0WonCFoBMt8V3YiQ=`
* **webhook-id** – a unique identifier for this webhook trigger, for example `msg_2M605iBQRge9hTgpYg7fKXQubaw`
* **user-agent** – the user agent used to process this trigger. Mendix uses [Svix](https://www.svix.com/), which returns something like `Svix-Webhooks/0.75.0`
* **webhook-timestamp** – the time the webhook was triggered, for example `1677072542`
* **test** – if this POST is a test, then this header will be included with the value `test`
* **content-type** – `application/json`
* **accept** – `*/*`
* **host** – the host part of the endpoing URL, for example `gitlab.com`

In addition, you can add your own custom headers. See [Setting Up a Webhook](#setting-up) for more information.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The order of these headers is not guaranteed.
{{% /alert %}}

## 4 Package Upload to Developer Portal

When you [upload a package to the Developer Portal](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#package-repository), and the webhook responds to the event **On package upload**, request content with the following format will be sent to the configured endpoint:

```json {linenos=false}
{
  "modelVersion": "0.0.19.62e3d711",
  "name": "main-0.0.19.62e3d711.mda",
  "packageId": "9222b92a-51ca-4932-a1f1-72c33ff76b86",
  "projectId": "f60650eb-230a-4419-a6af-b3668fc82d5d",
  "runtimeVersion": "9.18.1.54902",

  "uploaderId": "4bcafd1c-dac8-4335-b401-06ebe86f7851"
}
```

## 5 Model Upload to Team Server

When you push a model change to the [Git Team Server](/developerportal/collaborate/team-server/), and the webhook responds to the event **Teamserver push (Git)**, request content with the following format will be sent to the configured endpoint:

```json {linenos=false}
{
  "after": "4b76061182bf183281b5107cd753c6071ed00040",
  "before": "0b9cb7a3e9a5ccfffa6c79435441999543ccb8c9",
