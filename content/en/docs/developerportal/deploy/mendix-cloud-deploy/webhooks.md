## 1 Introduction

Webhooks in the Developer Portal allow you to send information about your Mendix app to an external app or workflow. This can be used, for example, to trigger an automated CI/CD workflow when a new change is committed to the Team Server.

Mendix provides webhooks to send project information when the following events happen to your app:

* On package upload – when a deployment package is available in the Developer Portal — this includes creating a package from the Teamserver
* Team Server push – when a new commit is pushed to the Team Server — this will only be triggered if your app is stored in a Git repository

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The deployment webhooks are set up and work independently of the [Webhooks used for Sprints and Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#webhooks)

## 2 Configuring a Webhook{#setting-up}

### 2.1 Creating a New Webhook

To set up a webhook, do the following:

1. Open your app in the Developer Portal.
1. Open the **Webhooks** page from the left-hand menu.

    You will see any current webhooks with an indication of whether they are active or inactive. An inactive webhook will not send any payloads to the endpoint.

1. Click **New Webhook**.
1. Enter the following information:
    * **Webhook Name** – a name, so you can identify the webhook
    * **URL** – the endpoint which will receive the payload when one of the event types selected in **Available Events** occurs
    * **Validation Secret** – a secret which is shared with the endpoint to verify that it has been triggered by this webhook — see [Verifying Your Webhook](#verify-webhook), below for more information
    * **Available Events** – the event or events which will trigger the webhook to send information to the endpoint. You can see more information about these events in the sections below
    * **Custom Headers** – a **Key**/**Value** pair which is sent as an HTTP header to the endpoint

You can edit or delete an existing webhook by clicking the ellipsis, **…**, in the **Action** column for the webhook you want to change and then select **Edit Webhook** or **Delete Webhook**.

### 2.2 Editing an Existing Webhook

If you select **Edit Webhook** from the ellipsis, **…**, in the **Action** column for a webhook you want to change, you have the following actions available to you:

* You can update **Webhook Name**, **URL**, and **Validation Secret** — click **Save** to save the changes.
* You can add or delete **Custom Headers** — click **Save** to save the changes.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}You cannot change the value of an existing custom header. If you want to change the value, delete the existing header and add a new one with the same key.{{% /alert %}}

* Click **Test Webhook** to send a test payload to the endpoint specified under **URL**.
* Click **(De)activate Webhook** to switch deactivate an active webhook or activate an inactive webhook.
* Click **Delete Webhook*** to completely remove the webhook.

## 3 Webhook Headers

Every POST payload contains the following delivery information as part of the header:

* **connection** – `close`, indicating that there is no further information for this HTTP request
* **content-length** – the size of the HTTP request in bytes, for example `475`
* **webhook-signature** – the signature of the webhook in the format `<version>,<signature>`, for example `v1,Ay2spGBdE7i6OzNkFgTDnGfqgZT0WonCFoBMt8V3YiQ=` — see [Verifying Your Webhook](#verify-webhook), below for more information
* **webhook-id** – a unique identifier for this webhook trigger, for example `msg_2M605iBQRge9hTgpYg7fKXQubaw`
* **user-agent** – the user agent used to process this trigger. Mendix uses [Svix](https://www.svix.com/), which returns something like `Svix-Webhooks/0.75.0`
* **webhook-timestamp** – the time the webhook was triggered, for example `1677072542`
* **test** – if this POST is a test, then this header will be included with the value `test`
* **content-type** – `application/json`
* **accept** – `*/*`
* **host** – the host part of the endpoint URL, for example `gitlab.com`

In addition, you can add your own custom headers. See [Setting Up a Webhook](#setting-up) for more information.

The order of these headers is not guaranteed.

### 3.1 Verifying Your Webhook{#verify-webhook}

You will want to verify that your endpoint has received a payload from Mendix and that the request hasn't been generated or intercepted by a bad actor. 

This verification is enabled through the `webhook-signature` which is sent in the webhook header. This is created automatically by the user agent. It is generated using the **Validation Secret** you provided when you set up the webhook in combination with the payload of the trigger using [HMAC-SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) authentication.

To verify the the signature, you need to reconstruct it and then compare it with the **webhook-signature** in the webhook header. This is done as follows:

1. Construct a string containing the signed content which is the `{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{webhook payload}`. Note the full-stop (`.`) between the three elements.
1. Calculate the **webhook-signature** using the HMAC-SHA256 function for your language and the **Validation Secret** you set up for the Webhook.
1. Ensure the result is base64 encoded.

    For example, in a bash script this might be:

    ```bash {linenos=false}
    WEBHOOK_ID=# from the header
    WEBHOOK_TIMESTAMP=# from the header
    PAYLOAD=# payload of the message
    VALIDATION_SECRET=# set when creating the webhook in the Developer Portal

    # to generate the signature:
    printf '%s.%s.%s' "$WEBHOOK_ID" "$WEBHOOK_TIMESTAMP" "$PAYLOAD" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -hmac "$VALIDATION_SECRET" | openssl base64
    ```

1. Compare **calculated-signature** with **webhook-signature** to ensure that they match. Note that the **webhook-signature** is prefixed by a version and a delimiter. For example, the signature for `v1,f7bc83f430538424b13298e6aa6fb143ef4d59a14946175997479dbc2d1a3cd8=` is just `f7bc83f430538424b13298e6aa6fb143ef4d59a14946175997479dbc2d1a3cd8=`

When verifying your webhook signature, bear the following in mind:

* The signature list **webhook-signature** is most commonly of length one. However, there could be any number of signatures.
* You should use a constant-time string comparison method in order to prevent timing attacks.
* You should also verify that **webhook-timestamp** is within your tolerance for the current system time, to ensure you are not receiving timestamp attacks where old webhook payloads are being sent to your endpoint.

## 4 Package Upload to Developer Portal

When you [upload a package to the Developer Portal](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#package-repository) (including creating a package from the Teamserver), and the webhook responds to the event **On package upload**, request content containing a payload with the following format will be sent to the configured endpoint:

```json {linenos=false}
{
  "modelVersion": "0.0.19.62e3d711",
  "name": "main-0.0.19.62e3d711.mda",
  "packageId": "9222b92a-51ca-4932-a1f1-72c33ff76b86",
  "projectId": "f60650eb-230a-4419-a6af-b3668fc82d5d",
  "runtimeVersion": "9.18.1.54902",
  "uploadTime": "2023-02-23T10:25:21.3896Z",
  "uploaderId": "4bcafd1c-dac8-4335-b401-06ebe86f7851"
}
```

Ensure you use the correct key names if using this payload information to call other Mendix APIs. The data may be labelled differently in the API.

## 5 Teamserver Push (Git)

When you push a model change to the [Git Team Server](/developerportal/collaborate/team-server/), and the webhook responds to the event **Teamserver push (Git)**, request content containing a payload with the following format will be sent to the configured endpoint:

```json {linenos=false}
{
  "after": "4b76061182bf183281b5107cd753c6071ed00040",
  "before": "0b9cb7a3e9a5ccfffa6c79435441999543ccb8c9",
  "branchName": "main",

      "authorName": "Balazs Bole",
      "id": "4b76061182bf183281b5107cd753c6071ed00040",
      "mendixVersion": "9.20.2.1234",
      "message": "Commit the changes",
      "relatedStories": [

  ],
  "projectId": "9bcd62a6-9c19-4c7f-a5ae-49182c67f80f",
  "repositoryType": "git"
}
```

## 6 Logging

You will see [log messages](/developerportal/operate/logs/) in the Developer Portal from the creation or update of your webhooks.

We do not create a log message for when a webhook is triggered.
