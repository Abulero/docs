## 1 Introduction

Epics is an efficient tool that enables your team to collaborate during the app development process.

Currently, you need to contact your Mendix Customer Success Manager to obtain the access to Epics.

Once you have the access to Epics, you can find **Go to Epics** on the upper-right corner of the [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/) page of your app in the Developer Portal.

On the top of page, you can see the name of the sprint, when it ends, how many stories and points it has. Below them, you can set a goal for the current sprint.

On the upper-right color, you can create an epic and create a story.
