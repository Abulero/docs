## 1 Introduction

**Product Insights** allows you to design mini surveys, enabling you to gain valuable feedback from the user group that you want to reach. It also helps you understand the survey results, with data visualization tools. Finally, it allows you to export your survey results to an XLSX file.

However, to get the mini survey up and running, developers of the app needs to implement your design using the [Product Insight](/appstore/modules/product-insight) module in Studio Pro.

## 2 Adding a New Project

To start designing a mini survey for an app, you need to enable **Product Insights** for this app. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the [General Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#2-general) page for this app.
2. On the **General** tab, copy the **App ID**. 
3. Go to **Project Insights**.
4.  Paste the app ID in the text box, as shown in the screenshot below.

5. Click **Add project**.

You should be able to see the app that you just added appears under **My Projects**.

## 3 Designing a Mini Survey

After you can access your app in **Product Insights**, you can start designing the mini survey for the app.

1. Go to **Project Insights** for this app.

2. Under **My Projects**, click the app for which you want to design the mini survey. The **Survey Overview** page opens. It contains all the existing surveys for this app, if there are any.

3. Click **Create New Survey**. The **Create New Survey** page opens.

4. Enter the following information for your survey:

   * **Background** – This includes the **Name** and the **Goal** your mini survey.

   * **Conditions** – This indicates how the mini survey should be set up. This is important for the developers who implement the mini survey in Studio Pro.
   * **Settings**
     * **Runtime** –  This defines the start and end time for the mini survey
     * **Toaster Placemen**t – This defines where the mini survey will appear on the page.
