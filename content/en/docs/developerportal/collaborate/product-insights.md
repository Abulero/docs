## 1 Introduction

**Product Insights** allows you to design mini surveys, enabling you to gain valuable feedback from the user group that you want to reach, and then help you understand the survey results, with data analyzing tools.



## 2 Adding a New Project

If you want to set up a mini survey for an app, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the [General Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#2-general) page for this app.
2. On the **General** tab, copy its app ID. 
3. Go to **Project Insights**.
4.  Paste the app ID in the text box, as shown in the screenshot below.

5. Click **Add project**.

After the app is added, you can see the app that you just added appears as a tile under **My Projects**.

2. Click **Create New Survey**. The **Create New Survey** page opens.

3. Enter the following information for your survey:

   * Background – This includes the **Name** and the **Goal** your survey.
