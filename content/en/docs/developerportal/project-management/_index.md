## 1 Introduction

In the Project Management section, your team members can collaborate efficiently during the app development process. 

We provide you with the following project management options:

* [Stories](/developerportal/collaboration/stories) – We plan to replace Stories with Epics in the fall of 2023. 
* [Epics](/developerportal/project-management/epics/) – This is the default project management tool.
* [Jira connector](/developerportal/collaborate/connect-jira/) – You can this option if you manage your project in Jira

If you are the [Scrum Master](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/) of your app, you can choose which option your team uses for project management. Based on your choice, the Project Management section may look differently.
