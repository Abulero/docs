## 1 Introduction

The **Project Management** section provides you with fast access to the project management tool that you select for your app:

* [Epics](/developerportal/project-management/epics/)
* [Jira](/developerportal/project-management/jira-connector)

{{% alert color="info" %}}If you can have the [App Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/team/#managing) permission, for example, if you are the Scrum Master of your app, then you can select which tool your team uses for project management on the [Project Management](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#project-management) tab on the **General Settings** page of your app. {{% /alert %}}
