## 1 Introduction

To start creating your designs with a UI kit, you must download [Mendix's Figma UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1291681319513425134).

Inside the kit you will find the following:

* Components that can be used as a library or copying and paste 
* Widgets and layouts on the first version 
* Building blocks and templates in the next one ( to be finished yet ) 
* You can design using the components that are up-to-date with the most recent Atlas Mendix framework

## 2 Prerequisites 

To use the Figma UI Kit to its fullest potential you will need the following:

* To use the kit's file as a library you will need a Figma subscription
* To take advantage of Figma's best features, download the Figma desktop app

## 3 Basics

To install the Figma desktop app, go to the Figma website, download the app, and install it.

## 4 Recommended Practices

The following are recommended practices:

1. Use the library and foundations on your app.  
1. Use the global local variables for changing the colors from your components.
1. Prioritize designing components from this kit, because they are already supported on Atlas and Studio Pro.
1. Use typographies that are supported by Atlas and are in the Figma UI Kit.

The following are *not* recommended practices:

1. Do not change the components' names (doing so will de-link them from the library).
1. Do not change the component layers' names.
