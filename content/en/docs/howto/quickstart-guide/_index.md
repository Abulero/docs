## 1 Introduction 

Get up and running with the Mendix Platform and start developing your first app after you create your [free account](https://signup.mendix.com/link/signup/?source=direct)⁠—which takes only two minutes to finish.

Then [download](https://marketplace.mendix.com/index3.html) and [install](/howto/general/install/) Mendix Studio Pro. Every app created with us automatically provisions a [Free Cloud Environment](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#free-app) the first time it is deployed, so you do not have to waste time provisioning a testing environment.

This tutorial will cover the essentials of Mendix development. When you are done you will have mastered the basics of building and hosting apps with Mendix and you will have your first app:

* Part 2: [Upgrade to a Native Mobile App](/howto/quickstart-part2/) (estimated time to complete: 25 minutes)
