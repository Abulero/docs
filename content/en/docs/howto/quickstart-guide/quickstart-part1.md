## 1 Introduction 

Before starting this tutorial, please [download](https://marketplace.mendix.com/index3.html) and [install](/howto/general/install/) Mendix Studio Pro as well as the [Make It Native 9](/refguide/getting-the-make-it-native-app/) app. You will not need any additional software configured on your device in order to start.

### 1.1 What is Mendix Studio Pro?

[Mendix Studio Pro](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/) is the Mendix integrated development environment (IDE) for professional developers. This tutorial will use Studio Pro version 9.12.1, but you can use a later version if one is available.

### 1.2 What is the Make It Native 9 App?

The [Make it Native 9](/refguide/getting-the-make-it-native-app/) mobile app is available for Android and iOS devices. Once installed, the app lets you quickly test your native mobile app as you develop it. Specifically, the Make it Native 9 app connects to your local development machineâ€™s running copy of your app and then displays your app inside its mobile testing environment. This lets you make changes to your app on your development machine, then instantly see those changes in the mobile app.
