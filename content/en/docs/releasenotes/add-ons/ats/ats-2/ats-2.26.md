## 2.26.0

**Release date: July 5th, 2022**

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue about loss of dataset fields and parameters bindings with Custom Actions Copy/Paste and Duplicate.
* The ATS prevents editing while updating the parameters to prevent possible data loss.
* The ATS shows a waiting dialog while fetching the fields of the Custome Actions, this is quite usefull when there are lots of parameters in a Custom Action.

### Improvements 

* The ATS now support Mendix DataGrid version 2.
