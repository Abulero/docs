### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We improved the performance of the [Open App](/refguide/open-app-dialog/) dialog box. In some scenarios, it will take less time to show the version numbers of the available apps.

#### Other Improvements

* For requests to published REST and OData services, the Mendix Runtime no longer creates a session in the database. Now, it keeps the session within the Mendix Runtime instance. (Ticket 187479)
* You can now update the contract of an OData service from the [Catalog](https://docs.mendix.com/catalog/) using a file or URL.
* In published OData resources with an insert or update microflow, the Mendix Runtime is now more precise in reporting client errors. When the microflow causes a validation error that is not caused by a parameter, the microflow now returns a "500 Internal Server Error" rather than a "422 Unprocessable Content" error.
* We added validation for the **Default value** property of Integer, Long, Decimal, and AutoNumber attribute types in dialog boxes and the **Properties** pane.
* We added support for the **Value** property of attribute types along with controls that depend on its value in the **Properties** pane while we hide the **Value** radio button for AutoNumber, Binary, and Hashed String attribute types in both the **Properties** pane and dialog boxes, because the value is always **Stored**.
* We added the possibility to quickly filter properties in the **Properties** pane by the name of a property or a group.
* A **Context** data source of a data view can now select an entity path from any surrounding data widget, including other data views.
* We updated the Git that is installed with Studio Pro to version 2.41.0.3-64-bit.
* We added the option to wait for all participant responses before completing a multi-user task in a workflow next to completing the task as soon as the final outcome is known.
* We added support for running Mendix apps on nested URL paths (for example, ` https://example.com/nested/path/mendix-app`).
* We made an optimization to the refreshing of MxAssist Logic Bot menu, which may help with larger apps.
* We improved the microflow and nanoflow return type dialog box usability.
* We updated dialog boxes to revert changes and close when an "oops" pop-up window message appears after clicking **OK** in order to prevent unexpected behavior due to an inconsistent data state.
* In the editors, we now show notification bars below the toolbar at the top of the screen.
* We improved the layout of pop-up windows by correctly placing and aligning the elements on the form.

### Fixes

* We have reworked calculating which state to send in case of object actions. This should solve many of the issues that people would run into with edge cases related to them. (Tickets 152735, 184397)
* We now encode file paths before logging them. This solves an issue where a log message could occupy multiple lines in the log. (Ticket 175643)
* Updating a widget to its latest version available on the App Store would return an error if that latest widget's supported Studio Pro version was greater than the version of Studio Pro used to update the widget. Now it is only possible to update to a widget supporting the version of Studio Pro in use, and not necessarily to the most up-to-date widget. (Ticket 183294)
* We fixed an issue where having a hidden custom close action button would prevent the default rollback behavior. (Ticket 184642)
* --We fixed an issue where scientific notation was not supported by the `parseDecimal` function in nanoflows. (Ticket 189270)
* We fixed an issue where creating a non-persistable entity could lead to errors when the entity contained a System attribute. (Tickets 189835, 190622)
* Fixed an issue where a role-based homepage microflow would not be called but would default to the default homepage instead. (Ticket 190880, 191014)
* We fixed an issue where it was showing Oops dialog when XML Schema file was located in a drive that does not exists. (Ticket 191015)
* --We fixed an issue where a data grid 2 module configured with an XPath data source with a `not equal` constraint did not apply the filters on associations that had been specified in the drop-down filter widget. (Ticket 191292)
* We fixed an issue where re-importing a module with a nanoflow that calls a microflow would cause running native apps to be unable to call that microflow. Runtime operations for microflow calls will now always have the same runtime operation ID. (Ticket 191302)
* We fixed an issue where an app containing an input widget with a page title override on one of its actions triggered an error in Studio Pro and could not be opened. (Ticket 192138)
* We fixed an issue where deployment failed when a Data grid 2 or a gallery widget used a database over association with selection enabled (Ticket 192500, 192875, 193161)
* We fixed an issue where a grid create button using a page parameter would cause a deployment error. (Ticket 192593)
* Importing a module from a version before 10.1 could incorrectly trigger consistency error CE7411 if the module contained a widget which called a page outside the imported module, such as the **Go to** page of a reference selector in the Excel Importer module. (Ticket 192867, 193026, 193410, 193736)




* We fixed a selection issue in the grid of a business event document.
* We now show a specific error message instead of the previously shown generic error popup when the microflow activity "Show user task page" (https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/show-task-page/) fails to open a user task.
* We fixed an issue where XPath expressions like `//A[A_B/B/attr = 'value'][A_B/B = $param]` would ignore the second constraint when its path ends in an entity name and is a prefix of the other path. Note that Studio Pro does not allow the form `[A_B/B = $param]`, only the equivalent `[A_B = $param]` or `[A_B/B/id = $param]`.
* We fixed an issue when after double-click of a node in a tree control, other elements (e.g. buttons) in the application did not get selected after a single click, but after a second click.
* We fixed an issue where names of callable actions were incorrectly shown in the microflow editor when the used actions are excluded from the project.
* We fixed an issue in published REST services for microflows that have an endless loop, for example one that commits an object in its own before-commit event handler. This now gives the appropriate response: 500 Internal Server Error.
* We fixed merging two branches case when it was port fix newly created document into the first branch and next the second branch is merged into the first one. In case a conflict for the document double click led to Oops dialog. 
* We fixed an issue where the Specializations nodes do not get expanded in the 'Select Attribute' dialog on hitting the 'Expand All' button of the tree control. 
* We fixed an issue where an app with the Security level set to Production would keep throwing an error if it contained a data widget using an association from a page or snippet parameter as its data source.
* We fixed an issue where access keys do not work in different controls.
* We fixed an issue where dragging a page, microflow or nanoflow from the App Explorer onto an existing action button or grid action button resulted in a consistency error if no default mapping was available for a parameter. Now an explicit mapping is automatically created for form parameters and selections, if there is only one matching option.
* We fixed an issue where database or XPath over association in an offline profile gave the incorrect results when the starting point of the association was not the direct enclosing data container.
