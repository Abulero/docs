## 10.1 {#101} 

**Release date: July 25, 2023**

### Improvements

* We added support for the following [language](/refguide/language-settings/): Basque (Euskara).
* We added the ability to search in tree controls for results that contain recursiveness in their data (for example, in the **Selector** dialog box that allows you to select an entity or attribute over associations).
* We added **readonly** description fields in the **Add** and **Edit** dialog boxes for [business event subscriptions](/appstore/modules/business-events/).
* We improved the configuration of parameter mappings for actions and snippet calls. This prevents them from changing automatically when you add a page parameter or snippet parameter to the surrounding form, or when you change a data grid's selection mode.
* The target document of an action or snippet call no longer requires the parameter mappings to be closed and reopened to be refreshed if they have become invalid.
* We added an ability to preview images in the **Properties** pane for entity and building block images.
* We now publish the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](/refguide/open-api/) for published REST services alongside the existing OAS or Swagger 2.0 specification.
* The Swagger UI of published REST services now shows a **Choose File** button when you are using a REST operation that takes a FileDocument (or derived entity) as a parameter.

#### Other Improvements

* We made it possible to switch off localization (time zone conversion) for DateTime attributes of external entities (Ticket 188260).
* We restored the ability to change the **Visible for** page setting from the **Properties** pane. (Ticket 189995)
* We made the workflows behavior for user tasks more consistent. If the number of targeted users is fewer than the required number of users, then the user task will always fail.
* We have updated spacing between the toolbar control elements.
* We updated the `mx check` tool so it refers to the rebranded Best Practice Bot (formerly Performance Bot).
* We enabled more translations of error messages generated by the Mendix Runtime. 

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue when retrieving a non-persistable entity over association and the entity has a generalization with a calculated attribute. (Ticket 188255)

* We fixed the issue when Documentation pane does not show the documentation corresponding to the selected element in certain conditions (Ticket 185876).
* We fixed the functionality of the 'Collapse All' button in the tree control: It should collapse all nodes in the tree, even when there is only a single root node in the tree.
* We fixed an issue where the runtime for published REST services would give an error when an operation microflow would set a non-standard http status code for the http response.
* We fixed an issue where compilation of Java actions fails when annotation processors are used. (Ticket 186516)
* We fixed the tooltips that were not displayed for disabled toolbar buttons.

(Ticket 117735)
* We fixed [CVE-2022-34716](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-34716).

* We fixed an issue where the XPath constraint of a data source could produce incorrect results if the widget was placed inside a pluggable widget and the constraint was using attributes from a page variable (such as $currentObject). (Ticket 178210)
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would crash if you accidentally dropped a container widget onto itself. (Ticket 189191)

This resulted in an empty text in the client, e.g. for the dynamic text property of a data grid 2 column. (Ticket 188724, 188403)

### Known Issues

TODO: CHECK IF THE KI FROM 10.0 MUST REMAIN

### Known Issues

* The algorithm for detecting conflicts during the migration of workflows with active multi-user tasks is currently too rigid and will not allow a conflicted user task to be continued in certain cases. In a future release, we will provide better migration scenarios where workflows with conflicted multi-user tasks can be continued. These are the situations in which a multi-user task is marked as **Incompatible** without continue:
    * The type of decision method (as in, **Consensus**, **Majority**, **Threshold**, or **Veto**) is changed.
    * A **Majority** decision method is changed from **More than half** to **Most chosen**.
    * A **Threshold** decision method is changed from **Percentage** to **Absolute number** or vice versa.
    * The **Percentage** or **Amount** value for the **Threshold** decision method is lowered.
