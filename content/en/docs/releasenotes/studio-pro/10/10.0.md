### New Features

* We added new options to the [Aggregate list](/refguide/aggregate-list/) activity. **All** and **Any** are new aggregation functions that you can use to check if an expression is true for respectively all or any of the items in a list. Next to this, the **Reduce** aggregation has been added to allow you to turn a list of values into a single value using an expression. In this expression, both `$currentObject` and `$currentResult` are available to create a new `$currentResult`. Finally, all aggregations that could be used with a specified attribute can now also be used with an expression instead. In this expression, `$currentObject` is available to access the item of the list that is currently being processed. [**ASK TW: 6044**]
* We added a new workflow activity and a related microflow activity. You can use the **Wait for notification** workflow activity to suspend a workflow's execution, and you can use the **Notify workflow** microflow activity to send a notification to resume the workflow that has been suspended via the Wait for notification workflow activity. [**ASK TW**]
* We introduced a new nanoflow activity called **Clear from device** which can be used to clear the objects of an entity from the device database. Objects that are cleared using this activity are not synchronized with the server database, and references to such objects are not  cleared. [**ASK TW: 5982**]

### Improvements

#### Selecting Entity path in Database, XPath and Association data source for Pluggable Widgets

Pluggable widgets with a Database, XPath or Association data source can now select an entity path from any surrounding data widget. This also allows them to be used in snippets with multiple parameters.

### New Features for Page URLs 

Page URLs got a major overhaul and now support multiple page parameters, using other attributes than `Id` in the URL and allow the variable segment(s) to be placed at any location in the URL.

### Other Improvements

* We removed the 'None' button when selecting an insert, update or delete microflow for a published OData resource, because it would always result in a validation error.

* We have updated the colors used in dialogs.
* We have updated the style for the following UI components: 'Button', 'Checkbox', 'Dropdown', 'Radio button', 'Stepper', 'Label' and 'Text field'.
* We have updated the style for the following UI components: 'Link', 'Checkbox List', 'Groupbox', 'Splitter', 'Text Editor' and 'Date and Time Selector'.
* We have updated the style for the Tab Control.
* We have updated the style for the 'App Selector' screen.
* We have updated the style for the 'Alert' control (i.e. an alert about merge conflicts).
* We have made the drop-shadow style of various UI components more consistent.
* We have updated the sign-in response pages to include the new logo.
* We have updated the style of the selection in text fields.
* We have updated the icons of the message dialogs.
* We added the `IMxRuntimeRequest.getRootUrl` method to the public API. This method can be used to retrieve the root URL of the application.
* We improved the message which is shown if no suitable argument is available for a parameter mapping (for example in the **Page settings** of a **Show a page** action): it now includes the expected type of the parameter.
* When creating a new workflow it is now possible to select a context entity through the creation dialog instead of adding it afterwards.
* We changed limit to current tab and limit to uncommitted filters in Performance Bot to only use cause location when filtering
* We enhanced the workflow lock and unlock microflow activities by allowing to select the workflow definition, which is a runtime workflow object, making the activity more reusable.
* We added highlighting of the tree and grid control rows, which are hovered over with the mouse.
* We updated colors for the Tree and Grid controls.
* We improved the discoverability of exposing microflows as microflow- and workflow actions by adding this option to the context menu of the microflow editor.
* We improved data encryption in mobile apps. (Ticket 181442)
* Performance Bot Best Practice MXP003 Non Indexed Attribute used in Sorting now extended to same attribute types as MXP003 Non Indexed Attribute used in XPath.
* We updated the 'Revert All Changes...' menu to show the App Selector dialog if the project gets closed after the operation (e.g. when the changes include a version change).
* We added a column displaying the Mendix Studio Pro application version in the App Selector branches data grid.
* We added a column in the App Selector data grid displaying the Mendix Studio Pro application version for local apps that are stored on disk.
* We added a new Performance Bot Best Practice MXP016 to find Key of OData Source that is missing an index.
* We added a Category column to the Best Practices of Best Practice Bot.
* We changed the default location for a published OData service to use lower case.
* We added a new Performance Bot Best Practice MXP016 to find Key of OData Source that is missing an index.
* We added an option to the mx check command to output results to a JSON file
* Cloning another branch of a Git project of which you already have a branch on disk, will now first make a local copy and then download the latest version from the server, instead of completely downloading the branch for the server. As Git always downloads the entire history, whereas SVN only downloads the latest revision, making this local copy significantly speeds up working with branches for Git apps.
* Configuring pluggable widgets with association properties is now easier. When selecting an association, the selectable object data source will be configured with a default database source. Switching from a database to an XPath data source keeps constraints and the selected entity path.
* We added `getSslContext` to the `IHttpConfiguration` interface in the runtime api. This gives java code access to the SslContext that should be used to call a service, based on the runtime settings.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in the OpenApi contract of published OData services where the Server URL would contain a double slash.
* We fixed an issue in published OData services that use links as object id's, where an inherited association could not be published. (Ticket 181474)
* We fixed an issue where an object validation would get removed incorrectly. (Ticket 180011)
* We fixed an issue where objects would sometimes get garbage collected for pages with multiple page parameters. (Ticket 180470)
* We fixed an issue in the OpenApi contract of a published OData service. GET operations no longer specify the $expand parameter when there are no associations to expand. (Ticket 182627)
* We fixed the Create Object Activity so that it now produces a consistency error when committing an external object.
* We fixed an issue in published REST services where publishing two REST services on the same location would cause a consistency error. However, this is not a problem as long as the services do not publish resources and operations that result in the same operation URL. (Tickets 185087, 185423)
* When opening multiple modal popups at the same time it was in some situations not possible to focus widgets in the popup which was on top. (Ticket #180137)
* We fixed an issue where the debugger would give an error and disconnect after 30 seconds of inactivity. (Ticket 151937, 169696, 175161, 175542, 178553, 180332)
* We fixed an issue where the workflow user task on-state-change microflow would not run again when the state changes to failed due to a prior execution error in the same event handling microflow
* We fixed an issue where non-localized date/time attributes in XPath constraints were not handled correctly, producing incorrect queries. (Ticket 176850)
* We fixed an issue which triggered a consistency error on a text template of a pluggable widget inside a snippet with multiple parameters if the template had parameters based on an attribute.
* We fixed an issue which caused the attribute of conditional visibility settings or text template parameters of a button inside a Reference set selector to be no longer selectable, resulting in a consistency error. (Ticket 182203)
* We fixed an issue in the OpenApi contract of published REST services, where operations that use an import mapping would have a schema defined for the other parameters, and not a type. (Ticket 182615)
* We fixed an issue when adding external entities to an app, where the generation of enumeratons would sometimes cause an error.
* We fixed the issue that language sensitive parts on pages are not fully updated when a user changes his language via the Language Selector widget. (Ticket 180130, 180670, 180824, 181274, 181713, 181974)
* We fixed CVE-2023-30547
* We fixed an issue where Performance Bot was not skipping disabled microflow actions - this did not cause any false positives, but caused some Best Practices to output no results for some apps.
* We fixed a crash in the sign-in, that blocked some users to sign-in with their users (Ticket 181864, 183014)
* We fixed an issue where clicking the 'load more' button on a list view triggered the on click on a surrounding widget. (Ticket 365439)
* We fixed an issue with text controls where the text was sometimes undesirably reverted.
* We fixed an issue in the grid control where selecting multiple cells using 'Shift' was inconsistent (when clicking on the interactable control itself in the cell, i.e. CheckBox).
* Fixed an error in OData write in case when user has no access to entity's association and there was an attempt to change its value. Runtime used to produce response with status 500. Now it is an error response with status 422.
* We fixed an issue where deployment fails on Linux operating system when module names contains upper case letters (Tickets 183841, 183872).
* We fixed an issue where importing a file from before version 9.24 would cause a lot of errors to appear. (Ticket 182860)
* We fixed an issue where ML Kit has an issue when the app is running
* We fixed an issue when ML mapping document is moved underlying ONNX file was not copied to new location.
* We fixed an issue which caused the warning dialog for the **Inline snippet** action to mention the same affected widget multiple times.
* We fixed an issue which caused the **Inline snippet** action to crash if a surrounding data widget was not configured yet.
* We fixed an issue where attribute widgets (such as Text box) did not trigger a consistency error if the selected attribute had an invalid source, causing an error when deploying the app. (Ticket 183379)
* We fixed an issue where a page parameter triggered a warning that it was unused if the only reference to that parameter was inside an XPath constraint.
* We fixed an issue where a page parameter sometimes did not trigger a warning that it was unused if the parameter mapping of an action or data source pointed to an object of the same entity as the parameter.
* We made it possible to use the scrollbars in disabled grids.
* We fixed the documentation links in Studio-Pro to point to Mx10 docs (instead of Mx9 docs).
* We fixed an issue with search field with multiselect not working correctly with numeric attributes.
* We fixed an issue where the `originURI` cookie could not be read when using the default `index.html` (ticket 181106).
* We fixed the color of the term `empty` and the `-` symbol in the XPath constraint editor (Ticket 183998).
* We fixed an exception in the XPath constraint editor which was thrown when having the list of autocomplete suggestions open and typing an erroneous character.
* We fixed an issue where expressions in pluggable widgets were not updated correctly when renaming an element (like a module or an entity), causing consistency errors.

### Deprecations

* For published OData services, publishing OData version 3 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use OData version 4 instead.
* We deprecated deploying directly to Cloud Foundry from Studio Pro. The functionality will be removed in Mendix 11.
* We removed deprecated methods from the public API and the M2EE API.
* We deprecated the `Counters`, `Gauges`, `Sets` and `Timers` interfaces from the public API. These will be removed in Mendix 11.

### Breaking Changes

* For published OData Services, Studio Pro now gives a consistency error when the exposed name of an attribute or association is the same as the exposed name of its entity, because that is not valid according to the OData standard.
* The validation of exposed names in published OData services now follows the OData standard more closely, with 128 characters being the maximum length for OData 4 services.
* We no longer support responding with custom reason phrases. This means that:
  * We removed `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IMxRuntimeResponse.setStatus(int, String)` from the Runtime API.
  * Published REST services no longer allow returning a custom reason phrase. When an operation microflow sets the `ReasonPhrase` attribute of the `System.HttpResponse` parameter, that value will now be ignored.
* We upgraded the SQL Server JDBC driver to version 12.2.0. Since version 10 the driver uses TLS encryption by default.
  You can turn off encryption by setting `DatabaseUseSsl` to `false` or by setting `encrypt=false` in `DatabaseJdbcUrl`.
* We removed deprecated direct function calls from the Pluggable Widget API for [linked property values](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-client-apis-list-values/#linked-values).
* We upgraded `com.sun.xml.ws.jaxws-ri` from `2.3.6` to `4.0.1`. As a result, the `SOAPFaultException` that may be thrown by consumed web services is now in the `jakarta.xml.ws` namespace.
* We removed deprecated reporting category widgets. Any reporting category widget in an existing project will now trigger a consistency error.
* We removed the deprecated metrics types `statsd` and `logger`. We now only support Micrometer metrics, correspondingly the only valid value for the `com.mendix.metrics.Type` runtime setting is `micrometer`. We also removed the following legacy statsd runtime settings: `com.mendix.metrics.Host`, `com.mendix.metrics.Port`, `com.mendix.metrics.Items` and `com.mendix.metrics.FlushTime`. You can use the `Metrics.Registries` runtime setting to configure a statsd registry instead.

#### Generated Code Breaking Changes

* The public constructors of generated Constant and Microflow proxy classes are now private and the classes are marked final to prevent instantiation and derivation.
* The fields in Java Actions are now generated as final fields.
* Entity and List of Entity parameters in Java Actions are now initialized in the constructor and the accompanying `__[FieldName]` field will be generated as deprecated. To get access to the `IMendixObject` variant, call the `getMendixObject()` method on the field (or items in the list in case of a list).
* The methods `initialize(IContext, IMendixIdentifier)` and `getGUID()` on generated entity proxies are no longer generated.

#### Other Breaking Changes

* We updated a setting name - `StrictChangeBehaviour` to `ObjectManagement.StrictChangeBehavior`. This setting will be removed in Mendix 11. The behaviour will not be configurable henceforth
* We removed the request metric `mx.runtime.stats.handler.requests.[name]`, where name is the request handler name. This metric was replaced with the metric `mx.runtime.stats.handler_requests`, with the request handler name added as a tag.

## 10.0.0 Beta 1 {#1000-beta-1} - TO CONSOLIDATE WITH ABOVE

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We improved the performance of editing published web service operations. Operations that expose large data structures no longer cause Studio Pro to become irresponsive upon opening the editing dialog box. (Tickets 179950, 183039)

#### Other Improvements

* The new **Properties** pane that was introduced in [9.23](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/#new-features) is now the default and only option in Studio Pro. It gives you a good overview of what is going on while making it significantly easier to make changes.
* **New merge algorithm with fine-grained conflict resolution** is now the default and only option for conflict resolution in Studio Pro. Therefore, it was removed from the **New Features** tab of the **Preferences** dialog box.
* We improved the export size of the model. It should now be about half the size in a lot of cases. (Ticket 174121)
* We added a new way to convert between microflows and nanoflows by right-clicking the microflow or nanoflow in the **App Explorer**. For more information, see the alternative option specified in the [Converting a Microflow to a Nanoflow](/refguide/microflows/#convert-to-nanoflow) section in *Microflows* and in the [Converting a Nanoflow to a Microflow](/refguide/nanoflows/#convert-to-microflow) section in *Nanoflows*.
* We added support for signing in using a macOS external browser. This requires configuration. For details, see the [Configuring Your Windows Virtual Machine for Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac/#configuring) section in *Configuring Parallels*.
* We updated the login image shown on startup.
* We included dark-mode support for the login dialog box shown on startup.
* We updated the colors of the microflow editor.
* We updated the style for controls residing in a toolbar.
* We updated the style for button controls.
* We updated the style for the breadcrumb, loading bar, scrollbar, and tooltip UI components.
* We added highlighting for when you hover over tree control rows.
* For pluggable widgets with a system property Label, **Show label** is now set to **Yes** by default.
* We added a button to the toolbar of the workflow editor that enables the export of a workflow to an image.
* We added a button to filter MxAssist Performance Bot best practices to documents that are not yet committed to version control.
* We updated the MxAssist Performance Bot Best practice [MXP011](/refguide/performance-best-practices/#mxp011) to group recommendations together. There is one group for each stack of deeply nested views.
* We updated the MxAssist Logic Bot for when a Boolean decision is chosen (at the top level or in a loop) and both the true and false flows are created.
* We added <kbd>{F1}</kbd> help support to the MLKit document and fixed an issue with its **Properties** pane.
* Previously, a single XPath query could result in multiple SQL queries to the database, and if an XPath query was run outside of a transaction (meaning, not in a microflow, but in a data grid, for example), these SQL queries were run concurrently. This is no longer the case. This simplifies debugging, logging, and tracing.
* We added default values for the `ProcessedTasksCleanupAge` and `ScheduledEventsCleanupAge` Mendix Runtime settings. The default value is now 365 days for existing apps with data and 7 days for new apps or apps with an empty database. Previously, the default values were empty and required an explicit Mendix Runtime setting configuration in order to perform cleanup.
* We improved the naming generation in the JSON structure.
* In OQL, `Attribute = $Parameter` where the parameter is a collection containing only a `null` now checks that the attribute is `empty`. This now also works with the parameter on the left side.
* We introduced the new Mendix Runtime setting `StrictChangeBehaviour`. This setting is enabled by default. When this setting is enabled, trying to set an invalid value for an enum or a value for a calculated attribute will throw an `InvalidEnumerationValueException` or `ReadOnlyAttributeException` response, respectively. 

### Fixes

* We fixed [CVE-2023-29017](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29017).
* The `weekday-from-dateTime` XPath function  and the  `DATEPART(WEEKDAY, ...)` OQL function now return the documented values of (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday) for all supported databases. (Ticket 130641)
* We fixed an issue where it was possible to add a path after a non-object variable, which led to issues in a running app. (Tickets 171893, 172495)
* We adjusted consumed OData services to use query options in the request body when the given service is configured to do so and pagination with `@nextLink` takes place. (Ticket 176976)
* When a database transaction for a microflow does not perform any database operation for 10 minutes, it is automatically aborted. When the same microflow then does another database operation, this previously silently started a new database transaction, losing the earlier updates. Now, the microflow results in an error. (Ticket 174408)
* We fixed an issue in the domain model editor where an element outside the boundaries of the current view was not scrolled to when there was navigation via [Go to options](/refguide/go-to-option/). (Ticket 178829)
* We fixed an issue where a domain-level validation message could not be translated. You can now use the `mendix.lib.Validations.field_issue` system text to translate and change this message. (Tickets 180448, 181175)
* The results of [Find Usages](/refguide/find-and-find-advanced/#find-usages) now include enumeration values used for conditional visibility. (Ticket 180727)
* We fixed an issue in XPath constraint suggestions that gave incorrect suggestions when there were whitespace characters after comparison operators (`=`,`<`,`>`,`<=`,`=>`,`!=`). (Tickets 181673, 181908)
* We fixed an issue where an application with excluded *.jar* files failed to deploy. (Ticket 181931)
* We fixed an issue where creating a non-persistable entity led to errors when attributes were read-only.
* We fixed an issue in published web services where editing an operation that had a parameter and/or a return type that had been removed caused an error.
* We fixed an issue where the outcome selector dialog box for a completed workflow user task activity showed duplicate outcomes.
* We fixed an issue where exporting recommendations from MxAssist Performance Bot was including suppressed recommendations.
* We fixed a Mendix Runtime error that occurred when a microflow was no longer being used in an app after doing a hot reload in Studio Pro.
* We fixed an issue where the status of `ScheduledEventInformation` was `Completed` when the associated scheduled event failed.
* We fixed an issue in XPath constraint suggestions that gave incorrect suggestions when there were multiple predicates (meaning, expressions between the square brackets [`[`, `]`]).
* We fixed an issue that occurred with PostgreSQL and Oracle databases where the `DATEDIFF` function in OQL calculated the difference in calendar weeks, which was inconsistent with other databases that calculate the difference in full weeks.
* We fixed the issue where the `DATEDIFF` OQL function in Oracle threw an exception when calculating a difference in seconds.
* The return type of the `round()` function with the second parameter now always returns a Decimal, even if the precision is 0.
* The `ceil()`, `floor()`, and `round()` functions with a single argument now throw an exception if the result cannot be represented as an Integer/Long (for example, due to overflow).
* We aligned the behavior of aggregates in grids with attribute columns.

### Deprecations {#deprecations}

* We are in the process of deprecating SVN for Mendix 10. In Studio Pro 10.0.0 Beta 1, you can still download your SVN app from the Team Server. However, Studio Pro will see it as non-version controlled, and it will not allow you to perform any version-control operations on it like commit, update, or publish. In Studio Pro 10.0.1 Beta 2, all SVN support will be removed. For more information, see [How to Migrate to Git](/developerportal/collaborate/migrate-to-git/).
* We increased the default BCrypt cost factor from 10 to 12. A BCrypt cost factor below 12 is deprecated and will be forbidden in a future release. Use a BCrypt cost factor of at least 12.
* We removed the deprecated `com.mendix.core.UseMimeDecoderForBase64` Mendix Runtime setting. Base64 decoding is now always strict, as specified by RFC 4648.
* We removed the deprecated `rollbackTransAction()` method from the public `IContext` interface. Use `rollbackTransaction` instead.

### Breaking Changes {#breaking-changes}

#### Various Breaking Changes

* The `parseDateTime\[UTC\]` microflow functions now use [strict parsing](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/DateFormat.html#setLenient(boolean)) by default. To revert to lenient parsing, set the `com.mendix.core.LenientDateTimeParsing` custom Mendix Runtime setting to `true`. (Ticket 169612)
* Legacy scheduled events (meaning, those that are non-repeating or have a start time) are no longer supported. Mendix Runtime will fail to start if legacy scheduled events exist.
* In Mendix [9.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.0/), we removed support for Mendix Runtime uniqueness validation in preference of database uniqueness validation. There was still a custom setting to use the old behavior. This setting has now been removed.
* We are more strict in the URL formats we accept at the Mendix Runtime server. We no longer allow empty path segments (meaning, `//`, as in `http://your.app//`), ambiguous path segments (`http://your.app/%2e%2e/path`), or UTF-16 encoding (`http://your.app/path%u2192`).
* It is no longer possible to call `clear()` on the list returned by the `IDataTable.getRows()` API function. The list returned by `subList()` is no longer modifiable.
* Instances of `IDataTable`, `IDataTableSchema`, and `IDataColumnSchame` no longer provide equality. As of now, `equals()` and `hashCode()` are based on object identity.
* An XPath constraint of the form `[$objectVariable/BooleanAttribute]` (where the microflow variable is not set) used to be ignored. Now, it is treated as `[false()]`.
* Duplicate column names in an OQL query are no longer allowed.
* In OQL, using a path with an association in the `ON` clause of an `OUTER JOIN` is no longer allowed.
* In OQL, comparing an attribute to a collection parameter can only be done with the `IN` or `=` operators (as in, `Attribute IN $param`).
* In OQL, clauses like `Attribute = $RangeParameter`, `Attribute > RANGEBEGIN($RangeParameter)`, and `Attribute < RANGEEND($RangeParameter)` with an infinite range (from `null` to `null`) used to be ignored. Now, they are treated as `true`. This makes a difference when the clause has `OR` with another clause.  Similarly, `Attribute < RANGEBEGIN($RangeParameter)` with a range starting with `null` or `Attribute > RANGEEND($RangeParameter)`  with a range ending with `null` are no longer ignored, but treated as `false`.
* We changed the MIME type returned for *.js* files from the legacy `application/javascript` to `text/javascript`.
* We removed the deprecated error constants from `AdminException` and `IMxRuntime`.
* We removed the deprecated `IActionRegistrator#bundleComponentLoaded` method.
* We no longer support using DB2 as the database for applications.

#### Generated Code Changes {#generated-code-changes}

* The public constructors of generated `Constant` and `Microflow` proxy classes are now private, and the classes are marked final to prevent instantiation and derivation.
* The fields in Java actions are now generated as final fields.
* The `Entity` and `List of Entity` parameters in Java actions are now initialized in the constructor, and the accompanying `__[FieldName]` field will be generated as deprecated. To get access to the `IMendixObject` variant, call the `getMendixObject()` method on the field (or items in the list, in case of a list).
* The `initialize(IContext, IMendixIdentifier)` and `getGUID()` methods on generated entity proxies are no longer generated.
