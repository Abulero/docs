### New Features
    
* We added the option to use [Object type decisions](/refguide/object-type-decision/) and [Cast object](/refguide/cast-object/) activities activities in nanoflows. 

    {{% alert color="info" %}}This is based on an [upvoted idea from Fabian Recktenwald](https://forum.mendix.com/link/space/microflows/ideas/3227) submitted to the Mendix Idea Forum. Thanks, Fabian!{{% /alert %}}

* We added a new [Retrieve workflows]() microflow activity that  enables retrieving all the `System.Workflow` objects that are associated with the provided workflow context object. [**TW**]
* You can now use the `length` expression with list variables in both microflows and nanoflows.[ **TW**]
* We introduced a new attribute to the **System.Image** entity that is known as **EnableCaching**, which can be used to enable or disable image caching. This attribute's default value is set to **True**.
* We added the option to change the default URL prefix `/p/` for page and microflow URLs.

### Improvements
    
* Logic Bot [beta] now parameterizes Decision for Rules that return boolean or enumeration.
* Logic Bot [beta] now has Decision in the whitelist for Rules.
* Logic Bot [beta] now excludes recursive calls for calling MCA, NF, Rule (consistent with MCA).
* Logic Bot [beta] now parameterized for Create List, showing the available entities.
* Logic Bot [beta] now supports adding *all* case flows for an Enumeration Decision (including setting the case on a sequence flow that has no case value).
* Logic Bot [beta] bug fix: the generic recommendation for Create Variable was incorrectly creating a Change Object action activity.
* Logic Bot [beta] now always includes the recommendation to retrieve the first object from the database for a given entity, as well as the unconstrained recommendation.
* Logic Bot [beta] now has improved support for matching call-microflow parameters to the available variables.
* Logic Bot [beta] menu text now uses 'Create {entity} object' instead of just 'Create {entity}'.
* Logic Bot [beta] bug fix: the generic recommendation for Show Message was incorrectly creating a Show Page action activity.
* Logic Bot [beta] menu text: for calls to exposed documents, we now use just the exposed name, without any prefix (scope: call Java Action, Call Microflow, Call JavaScript action).
* Logic Bot [beta] now has improved support for matching call-Java-Action parameters to the available variables. Sorting has been simplified.
* Logic Bot [beta] has minor fix for sorting of Microflow Call recommendations.
* Logic Bot [beta] has improved menu text for List Operation, more consistent with the list operation properties form.
* We updated the bundled JDK to version 11.0.20.1.
* If using Oracle, the maximum length of names of database objects like tables and indexes has been increased to 128. (Ticket 200714)
* An app can now publish a REST service on URL prefix `ws/` or `odata/`, provided that it has no published web services or published OData services, respectively.
* We changed the icons and the background color of loops in the Microflow, Nanoflow and Rule editors.
* We improved GoTo functionality by excluding Marketplace modules and excluded documents from search by default. Marketplace modules and excluded documents can be included in the newly added filter options.
* Apps will now load the metamodel in parallel during startup. This should make startup of apps slightly faster in cases of high network latency.
* We improved the regeneration of outcomes in workflows when enumerations or enumeration values are deleted.
* For the pluggable widgets with system property 'label', you can now use ['setLabel'](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#setLabel) attribute in 'association' and 'attribute' properties to automatically set the widget's label in Studio Pro.
* We improved the data types selection for published REST operation parameters in Studio Pro. Body parameters cannot have a primitive data type and query, path and header parameters can only have primitive data types. Choosing those values would lead to a consistency error, anyway.
* The user interface of published OData services now consistently refers to published entities as published entities (as opposed to published resources)
* We changed Studio Pro to detect when an external date/time attribute that represents only a date has been localized, by giving a consistency error.
* We introduced a consistency error for associations that are traversed from child to parent in microflow/nanoflow expressions. This was not prevented before, but resulted in a runtime exception.

### Fixes
    
* Logic Bot [beta] bug fix: Delete Object recommendation was excluding some variables according to their type - this constraint has been removed.
* Logic Bot [beta] bug fix: applying a List Operation recommendation should create the List Operation with its variable set.
* Logic Bot [beta] bug fix: the initial menu could be missing its first item.
* Best Practice Bot now saves its settings in a more reliable way on closing an app. This may help with larger apps.
* We updated the list of valid timezone codes displayed in the runtime settings dialog in Studio Pro
* We added a critical warning during start up in case the timezone code in the model is not recognized by the running JVM
* We added a consistency check for invalid timezone codes in Studio Pro
* We fixed the `location` header in responses of the POST calls to now have a URL-Encoded value in published OData services.
* We fixed an issue in the entity dialog where one-way navigable associations would not appear in the list of associations for the child entity, allowing the user to add them again.
* We fixed an issue in the metadata of published OData services using OData version 4 (Ticket 200743).
* Logic Editors [Beta] We fixed the output descriptions of the Aggregate list actions
* Logic Editors (beta): We fixed updating Loop contents while the loop is being dragged.
* We fixed snap-to-object behavior in the beta microflow, nanoflow and rules editor if the dragged object started inside of a Loop.
* We fixed an issue where the items in the topbar of the [Beta] microflow, nanoflow and rules editors were selectable.
* We fixed a freeze of the UI in Studio Pro that could occur while trying to synchronize managed Java dependencies in the background. (Tickets 200938, 201025, 201225)
* We changed the Servlet and WebSocket API dependencies for Java actions. `javax.servlet.servlet-api.jar` is replaced by `org.eclipse.jetty.toolchain.jetty-servlet-api.jar` and `javax.websocket.websocket-api.jar` is replaced by `org.eclipse.jetty.toolchain.jetty-javax-websocket-api.jar`.
* We improved the interaction of app opening/closing with the background syncing of Java dependencies in Studio Pro.
* We fixed an issue when validation rules were missing the assigned attribute when copying and pasting entites between the modules.
* We fixed a bug where a URL template using the short-hand notation `{Entity}` led to a malformed URL in the client
* We fixed an issue where inherited attributes from a generalisation could not be used in an URL template.
* We fixed an issue where negative numbers were not allowed in XPath constraints. (Ticket 200357)
* We fixed an issue with Scroll container widget having two scroll bars in some cases. (Ticket 187605)
* We fixed an issue where using the `System.changedBy` or `System.owner` association in an XPath constraint variable resulted in an error during deployment, e.g. `[MyFirstModule.Order_User=$currentObject/System.changedBy]`. (Ticket 197570)
* We fixed an issue in consumed web services where doing requests with attachments would fail due to a missing `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header. (Ticket 199235)
* We fixed an issue where the LastLogin attribute was not readable when it should be. (Ticket 192759)

### Deprecations
    
#### removal of the database data source
            
* Studio Pro has many options for data sources used in widgets to filter the data that it shows during runtime. We're getting rid of the database data source 
* Additionally, the xpath data source radio button label in the widgets' data source tab has been renamed to "Database" because our users are already used to it

#### Other Deprecations
            
* We dropped support for PostgreSQL 11, as it is no longer supported by the vendor.
- UPDATE SYSTEM REQ

### Breaking Changes
    
* We have upgraded the MariaDB JDBC driver (also used for MySQL) to [major version 3](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-j/). 
    * If you use a DatabaseJdbcUrl with MariaDB or MySQL, you may need to use different [connection properties](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-j/#connection-strings).
    * When using MySQL, [insert performance](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-1077) of many objects may be affected.
    * When using MySQL, setting a query timeout [has no effect](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-1107).

### Known Issues

* A finished parallel split branch that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict.
