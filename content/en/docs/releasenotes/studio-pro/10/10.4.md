### Known Issues

* [**FIXED?**] When selecting a container widget in **Structure mode**, it can appear that it does not have any properties. This happens because clicking the border of the container selects the drop-zone instead of the widget. 
    * Workaround: It is still possible to select the widget by clicking the left side of it.
* A finished parallel split branch that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict.
