### New Features

* We added a new feature that allows you to reverse an association direction by right-clicking the [association](/refguide/associations/) and selecting **Reverse direction**. [**TW: /refguide/associations/#33-move-the-association-arrow**]

#### Java Dependency Management

We have released managed Java dependencies. This feature enables specifying *.jar* dependencies per module in your app, so that Mendix can automatically handle conflicts between modules for you.

Specified dependencies are resolved through Gradle and downloaded from the Maven central repository or a custom repository. In the case of conflicting dependencies between modules, Gradle automatically selects the newest one, solving most compilation issues.

The *.jar* dependencies are downloaded into the new Mendix-controlled **vendorlib** folder and are committed into version control. The **userlib** folder stays available for unmanaged dependencies.

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We improved the startup performance of Studio Pro.

#### Microflow URL Improvement

We added the option to define a URL for a microflow. When you navigate to this URL, the microflow is executed during the client startup. The URL can contain both object parameters (just like page URLs) and primitive parameters. 

If the microflow contains a [Show a page action](/refguide/on-click-event/#show-page), this page is opened instead of the home page. Otherwise, the client opens the home page as usual after executing the microflow.

#### Other Improvements

* We added support for opening a properties dialog box in read-only mode in the **Properties** pane. [**TW**]
* We added the possibility to define a custom/microflow decision method for workflow multi-user tasks. [**TW: "custom" and "microflow"?**]
* We moved the deployment settings to the new **Deployment** tab in the Studio Pro [Preferences](/refguide/preferences-dialog/). [**TW**]
* You can now use a **Share** URL from the [Catalog](/catalog/) to update a consumed OData service.
* We made it easier to realign the [Call external action](/refguide/call-external-action/) activity with the changed contract of a consumed OData service.
* We improved the resizing behavior of the [End Event](/refguide/end-event/) and [Decision](/refguide/decision/) dialog boxes in the microflow editor.
* A warning is now shown when a new document is created with a name that captures existing usages.
* We added the ability to preview images in the **Properties** pane for button widgets and the Image widget in the page editor. [**TW: which image widget?: https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/image-and-file-widgets/**]
* Mendix now updates the objects sent with the [Send external object](/refguide/send-external-object/) activity based on the reponse from the publishing side.
* We now show an information bar in the [Edit External Action Parameter Mapping](/refguide/call-external-action/#edit-parameter-mapping) dialog box when the parameter is not allowed to be empty.
* We added a log message to indicate that Mendix Runtime shutdown was requested through `ShutdownAction`.
* We added the ability to change the return value of the end event for microflows, nanoflows, and rules through the **Properties** pane. [**TW**]
* A "current activity removed" conflict is no longer reported when a parallel split branch with currently executing activities is removed from a workflow. Instead, only  a "parallel split branch removed" conflict is reported.



* We added a module-import command to mx.exe (https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/module/#module-import)


* We no longer support the old {Id} format in page URLs. All existing page URLs with {Id} will be converted to the new format of {PageParameter/Id}.
* We improved Commit and push UX when remote changes exist on the remote (https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/#43-pushing).
* We corrected the validation of new branch name and made it case insensitive so now it is impossible to create a branch with a reserved name (e.g. MAIN, maiN or MaIn)
* We made all association settings available in *Properties* pane.
* Microflows published in an OData service can now take a parameter of type `System.HttpResponse`, allowing them to return errors. 
* External Enumerations now show the source of enumeration and allows the user to 'Detach' it from the source.

DONE - UI
* We improved the UI for the page URL editing form.
* We updated the [Batch replace](/refguide/batch-replace/) dialog box to support dark mode.
* We added support for dark mode to the pop-up window that warns about existing usages when something is renamed.


### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where the drop-down filter in the Data grid widget was not closed when the page was scrolled. Starting with this version, multiselect filters in the Data grid will be closed as soon as the page is scrolled. (Ticket 163319)
* We fixed an issue where importing large XML Schema documents was too slow. (Ticket 170962, 185085)
* We fixed an issue where a text area would ignore a value autofilled in Chrome. (Ticket 176195)
* We fixed an issue with calling a microflow action where retrieving a specialization over association did not work if the other side was the generalization. (Ticket 187667)
* We fixed an issue that caused the batch button icon update dialog to throw an exception, this includes adding an extra native icon selector when there are native documents and the selected icon is not supported on native. (Ticket 191511)
* We fixed an issue in the $metadata of published OData services using OData version 3 where a self-referencing association could result in two roles with the same name (Ticket 193467).
* We fixed an issue where an XPath data source with a constraint which used the `id` attribute of a variable, e.g. `[Module.Person_House/Module.House/id=$currentObject/id]`, resulted in an error during deployment. (Ticket 194055)
* We fixed an issue where setting a new authtoken would not apply until a restart of the native app. (Ticket 195005)



* We fixed an issue where some properties in the *Properties* pane look editable, but do not actually change the value of the property.
* We fixed a crash that could occur when selecting the 'Find Usages' menu item from the 'Edit' main menu.
* We fixed an issue where styling properties were not initially populated in the *Properties* pane.
* We fixed an issue to prevent an “oops” pop-up window when selecting an entity through the context menu or dragging it from the *Connector* pane and for which a page or snippet parameter did already exist.
* We now allow the use of aggregate functions in XPath constraints, so you can use `sum`, `avg`, `count`, `min`, or `max` in a predicate. Note that in that case you should do that over a value over association. So for example: `[sum(MyModule.OrderLine_Order/MyModule.OrderLine/Price) > 100]`. The aggregate functions support an optional second argument of type boolean to identify whether the values should be distinct by the database before applying the aggregate function.
* We now also allow the use of calculations in paths of XPath constraints, so you can use operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `div`, `mod` in paths. This allows constraints like: `[sum(MyModule.OrderLine_Order/MyModule.OrderLine/(Amount * Price)) > 100]`.
* We fixed an issue that when using operators like '+', '-', '*', 'div', and 'mod' in client side XPaths that Studio Pro allowed them to be used, while the Runtime Server would reject those XPaths.
* We fixed an issue that when using the 'div' operator in XPaths with integer/long operands that the result was a decimal in MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle and SAP HANA.
* We fixed an issue that when using the 'div' operator in XPaths with at least one decimal operand that the result was a integer in HSQLDB.
* We fixed an issue that when using the '+', '-', '*', 'div', and 'mod' operators in XPaths with at least one decimal operand that the result was a integer in HSQLDB and SAP HANA.
* We fixed an issue that when using the '+' operator in XPaths with at least one string operand and at least one non-string operand that the query failed in Microsoft SQL Server.
* When consuming an external action, Studio Pro may add entities to the domain model. It now adds these entities to the domain model of the module that the consumed OData service is in, rather than the domain model of module that the microflow is in.
* We fixed an issue that when using the '+' operator in XPaths with at least one string operand and at least one operand that resulted in NULL that the result was NULL too (we switched to use the CONCAT function for string concatenation), now the NULL value is ignored.
* We fixed an issue where the grid control does not highlight the selected row.
* We fixed a NullPointerException that occurred when passing `null` to the `getValueFromString` method of `MendixBinary` members. This method now returns `null` when passed `null`.
* We fixed an issue in published REST services where messages about import mapping errors would duplicated in the response body.
* We adjusted Best Practices MXP003, MXP007 and MXP016 to not recommend adding an index to an attribute that is uniquely constrained.
* We updated the HTTP response status-codes for POST/PATCH on the publishing side depending upon the provision of "Prefer" header in the request.
* We improved the layout of some popup dialogs.
* We added a prefix to the BE Entity name when it is created. If users decide to implement both publishing and subscribing of an event, there will be two entities created automatically. One of the entities will be automatically renamed to eventName_2. With a prefix, it will be more meaningful. 
* We fixed an issue where dropping a Call external action activity in a microflow could cause the activity to be placed at an incorrect location in the canvas.
* We fixed an issue where it was not possible to use the [constrained by](/refguide/reference-selector/#selectable-objects) functionality, with [Reference selector](/refguide/reference-selector/) and [Input reference set selector](/refguide/input-reference-set-selector/) widgets when the configured attribute path did not start from the direct enclosing data container.

### Deprecations

* Starting with version 10.5, we will drop support for PostgreSQL 11, as it is no longer supported by the vendor.


### Breaking Changes

* We removed the "Build with Gradle" option from the Deployment settings. We now always use Gradle for project deployment.

### Known Issues

* A finished parallel split branch that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. [**VERIFY VIA PROCESS**]
* When a [shortcut](/refguide/studio-pro-overview/#shortcuts) is used to access the [Go to](/refguide/go-to-option/) dialog box, the input field does not receive initial focus. [**FIXED?**]
