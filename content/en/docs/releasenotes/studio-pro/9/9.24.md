### New Features

* We added a new feature that allows you to convert a microflow into a nanoflow and vice versa. You can easily convert between the two by right-clicking in the microflow/nanoflow editor. [**TW DOC**]

    {{% alert color="info" %}}This is based on an idea from Luke Sheldon submitted to the [Mendix Idea Forum](https://forum.mendix.com/link/space/microflows/ideas/1600). Thank you, Luke!{{% /alert %}}






* We added a way for users to create a new app from a spreadsheet: the Data Importer. This feature can be accessed from the new Starting Points in the App Creation page and will generate entities, associations, attributes and data for the app.
* We introduced a new synchronization mode: **Never**. When you set synchronization to Never for an entity, its objects will not be synchronized between the Mendix Runtime and the offline database during a Full Synchronization. The objects can still be synchronized using Sync-to-Device or Selective Synchronization, but you will be in control when and what is synchronized.





* We added a new [Range](/refguide/list-operation/#range) operation action to the **List operation** activity.
* We added a new setting in **Preferences** > **Advanced** that allows you to enable software rendering mode.  [**TW DOC**]

#### Custom Icon Support

We added the ability to use custom icon fonts within projects. This will give users freedom choose between using their own icons and the ones provided by our own glyph icons.
This feature allows users to:

* Create icon collections.
* Import icons from icon font files (.ttf).
* Add tags to the invidual icons.
* Choose a name for each icon.
* Bulk import icon tags, and names from a CSV file.
* Configure icon collections to use a specific class name, and a dedicated prefix for it's icons.
* Use the icons within widgets, page navigation, pages, building blocks, page templates, snippets, and custom widgets.

More information on how to use custom icons can be found in the [documentation](content/en/docs/refguide/modeling/pages/page-resources/icon-collection). [**VERIFY**]

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We reduced the CPU usage of Studio Pro when the application is idle.

#### Inline Snippet

The context menu option to inline a snippet call has been vastly improved. Leveraging the full power of multiple snippet parameters, *Inline snippet* will now replace all references to a snippet parameter with the corresponding mapping in the *Snippet settings* of the snippet call when inserting the content of the snippet. There are a few cases where a widget cannot be correctly represented when inlining a snippet, which will now trigger a warning dialog that lists the affected widgets and asks you if you want to continue. This makes it significantly easier to inline a complex snippet without introducing errors.

#### Selecting Attributes

* In conditional settings
    * It is now possible to select an attribute from any surrounding data widget when configuring conditional visibility or editability. This includes snippets with multiple parameters.
* In text templates
    * For parameters of a text template, it is now also possible to select an attribute path from any surrounding data widget or snippet parameter. 
* In association widgets
    * Reference selector and Input reference set selector can now select an attribute from any surrounding data widget. This also allows them to be used in snippets with multiple parameters.

#### Other Improvements

* We will now retrieve non-persistable objects over a direct association without sending a request as long as they have no virtual attributes.
* We added support for the following database versions:
    * MariaDB 10.11 [**SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS?**]
    * PostgreSQL 15
    * SQL Server 2022
    * Oracle 21c
* We now build projects using Gradle. You can switch back to Ant in the Studio Pro settings.
* It is now possible to use enum attributes in Consumed OData Entities
* Private Git is now always enabled. No need to enable it in Studio Pro Preferences
* It is no longer possible to create new apps with SVN as version control. You can still download existing SVN controlled apps
* Solution upgrade is now possible on all branches
* We now made 'Count' the default aggregate list function.
* Now a workflow user task that failed due to no users targeted by a microflow can be retried after users are assigned manually
* We revised Performance Bot Best Practice MXP015 XPath Ordering to avoid false positives.
* We added a general note to the Performance Bot recommendation popups.
* We extended the Performance Bot Best Practice MXP003 Non Indexed Attribute Used in Sorting, to include the Integer type.
* We aligned the status codes and error messages a published OData service returns for a number of cases where the resource is either not existing or not accessible. In these cases we now return status 404: "Resource not found."
* We updated the Dojo library to version 1.17.3.
* We added a button that opens the "Open App" help page to the App Selector dialog.
* We now provide more accurate drag & drop feedback on Domain Model and Navigation editors and fixed incorrect feedback for a few controls.
* We updated the Data Grid and Tree controls to allow scrolling the containing dialog using the mouse wheel when the cursor is over the controls, and the controls do not have a vertical scroll-bar.
* We improved the resizing behavior of the Entity Access Rules dialog. Now the 'Documentation' field does not take a lot of space anymore, instead the grid with Member Rights settings adjusts itself to the available space.

### Fixes

* <a id="empty-caption"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/#ki-empty-caption) where generating task pages for [user tasks](/refguide/workflow-elements/#user-tasks) that have outcomes with captions defined on them resulted in outcome buttons with empty captions on the generated page.
* We fixed an issue where a data grid column with an attribute from a reference set was showing empty entries for inaccessible objects in the comma-separated cell output in the client. (Ticket 141001)
* We fixed an issue where data grid 2 becomes slower with pagination. (Ticket 164178)
* We fixed an issue where document changer icons were missing, now the icons are displayed again. (Ticket 171390)
* We fixed an issue where icons on document tabs were missing, now the icons are back. (Ticket 171390)

* Whe fixed an issue where calling a microflow or nanoflow after selecting a file in the [file manager](/refguide/file-manager/) would clear the file. (Ticket 176285)
* We fixed an issue when 'Export to image' option is not enabled for Domain Model, Workflow, Microflow, Nanoflow, Rule and Document Template editors. (Ticket 177392)
* We fixed an issue with consumed OData services where retrieving associated entities that have equivalent key fields and values would lead to unpredictable query results. (Ticket 177537)
* We fixed an issue where sorting of a microflow or association data source in a pluggable widget, e.g. data grid 2, resulted in unnecessary network requests. (Ticket 177792)
* We fixed an issue in published web services where a client addressing a service with a slash would log an error. Such a URL is always incorrect, so this now results in a client error and a debug log message (Ticket 178489)
* We fixed an error shown when modifying excluded Document Templates. (Ticket 178508)
* We fixed an issue where templating was not being applied to JavaScript files in the theme folder, making it difficult to setup CSP properly. (Ticket 178688)

* We fixed the start-up of the console log while running from eclipse.
* We fixed an error that might appear after a validation message in the Properties dialog of a workflow activity.

### Deprecations

* We deprecated Core.isSubClassOf method variants. You can instead use the IMendixObject.isInstanceOf(IMetaObject), IMendixObject.isInstanceOf(String), IMetaObject.isSubClassOf(IMetaObject) or IMetaObject.isSubClassOf(String) methods to achieve the same result.
* We deprecated setter methods which were for internal use and have provided constructors as an alternative for these methods where ever applicable.
* We deprecated the com.mendix.core.Core.deleteAsync methods. Use the synchronous version or run the synchronous version in a thread if needed. We introduced a delete method with events and with the useDeleteBehavior parameter as a replacement for calling deleteAsync with useDeleteBehavior set to false.
* We deprecated async methods from com.mendix.core.Core(changeAsync, commitAsync, instantiateAsync, rollbackAsync). These operations directly influence transactional behavior, for which behavior is not stable if done asynchronously. If you do need to interact with the transaction, do so synchronously using the change, commit, instantiate and rollback methods in the existing context.

### Breaking Changes

* We have removed support for the FileID parameter in the File API.
