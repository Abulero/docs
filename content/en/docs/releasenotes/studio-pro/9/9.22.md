### New Features

* Native mobile apps now support encrypting files and images stored in the app. You can enable this feature on the native navigation profile settings page. Check out the [documentation](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/offlinefirst-data/local-data-security/) to learn more and start using it!
* When adding a new attribute to an entity, we will now try and guess the attribute type.
* It is now possible to open an app by dragging its mpr file or its containing folder into the main window of Studio Pro or into the App Selector.
* It is also possible to open a Mendix app package by dragging and dropping its mpk file into the main window of Studio Pro or into the App Selector.
* It is also possible to import Mendix module packages into an app by dragging and dropping the mpk/mxmodule file into the main window of Studio Pro.

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We expanded on the improvement made in version 9.21 and substantially reduced the time it takes to rename an entity and corresponding associations. For more complex entities with a lot of associations, the speed has been increased significantly, but it is also noticeable with smaller configurations.
* We reverted some changes we made in 9.18, 9.18 and 9.20 in the SQL that is generated for XPath queries. While these changes were intended to improve performance they caused performance regressions in some cases.
* We optimized the network requests while creating a new app and improved responsiveness when browsing starter app templates.

#### Extract Snippet

The context menu option to extract a widget to a snippet has been vastly improved. Leveraging the full power of multiple snippet parameters,
*Extract snippet* will now perform an analysis of the extracted content and determine exactly which objects from the surrounding form are used.
The new *Extract snippet* dialog shows which snippet parameters will be introduced and which objects they are a substitute for. You can also
change the suggested names and the order of the parameters here. After pressing OK, the extracted widget will be replaced by a snippet call widget
where its *Snippet settings* have been configured to pass the correct object to each snippet parameter. Inside the new snippet, all references
to outside objects are replaced with a reference to the corresponding snippet parameter wherever possible. This makes extracting a snippet from
complex pages significantly easier.

#### Git version control

* We made it possible to disable collaboration with Studio for an app's branch during it's convertion to version 9.21 and above.
* To prevent a situation where you cannot disable collaboration after it was mistakenly enabled again the disable collaboration button is accessible in Branch Line Manager for the collaboration enabled branches.

#### Other Improvements

* We now accept an optional timezone argument (literal string) to all xxx-from-dateTime() functions in XPath conditions and to the DATEPART and DATEDIFF OQL functions. (Ticket 122891)
* We improved the invalid decimal value error message by including the attribute name. (Ticket 171827)
* Consumed OData services use fewer parenthesis for filter expressions (Ticket 173408)
* We now warn the user if we detect they are running Studio Pro in Parallels and using the host computer as the browser during sign in, this is not supported by Studio Pro.
* JSON Structure now takes into account all array objects in the JSON Snippet. (Forum ideas: https://forum.mendix.com/link/ideas/3277)
    * When there are more properties in the next object(s), it will include those properties as well.
    * When it encounters a null property, it will keep searching until it finds a better data type for that property. 
* In offline PWA or native mobile profiles when a new version of the Mendix app is redeployed with domain model changes, an automatic startup synchronization is required. With this release we improved mendix client where for certain domain model changes it will skip this startup synchronization leading to a faster startup time.
* We improved the Studio Pro editor for published OData services. You no longer need to click an Edit button before you can type in the text boxes. 
* We added full message and Stack Trace to the CSV export of Console.
* We improved the formatting of SQL statements in log records.
* When dragging an entity from the data hub pane onto a domain model, the generated consumed OData service and constant are now placed inside a folder.
* For external entities that do not support skip or top, the _retrieve_ microflow activity no longer shows first, amount and offset.
* Now Send External Object and Delete External object activities report OData error responses into validation feedback
* Now Send External Object and Delete External object activities report OData error responses into validation feedback.
* We made multi-line text fields in dialogs resize when the dialog is resized.
* For published OData services, when you published an entity that does not have an attribute that is both unique and non-empty, Studio Pro no longer chooses the first attribute as a key, but rather does not choose a key and lets you decide. 
* We improved the way we show which UI element in Studio Pro has the keyboard focus. The focussed element has a dotted border around it. The style of this border is now consistent throughout the application.
* We improved the resizing behavior of dialogs and tabbed editors that contain sections with vertical scrollbars: these sections now correctly adapt to changes in the dialog or editor size.
* We improved consistency in visual presentation of focus on Studio Pro UI elements.
* The index selector and the published OData key selector in Studio Pro now both respond to double-clicking.
* Users can now disable sending usage data to Mendix.

### Fixes

* [**KI FIX**] We fixed a [known issue](add-link) where one-to-one associations were cleared incorrectly when there were multiple copies of the same object in microflow variables. (Ticket 168024)
* We fixed an issue where open link action button is not working in a data grid. (Ticket 113752, 164174)
* We fixed an issue where an associated object was not sent together with its parent in some cases. (Ticket 152735, 171646)
* We fixed the 'space bar' functionality in the grid control for 'check-box' cells: The user can now toggle on/off multiple checkboxes (Ticket 165926).
* We fixed the issue that the 'Properties' dialog of a widget would be too large to fit on the screen when it contains many properties. Now, the size of the dialog is limited and we show a vertical scrollbar instead. (Ticket 169365)
* We fixed an issue with file download when the file name attribute is empty. (Ticket 170237)
* We fixed an issue when Oops dialog appeared when opening Domain Model Editor in certain cases. (Ticket 170735, 170571)
* We fixed an issue that caused the native date input to not render properly on custom backgrounds. (Ticket 170882) [EDITED]
* We fixed an issue where a native mobile app was stuck on the splash screen after an end-user logged out. (Ticket 171288) [EDITED]
* We no longer send display inaccessible members as `(empty)` when debugging nanoflows. (Ticket 172185)
* We fixed an issue where opening a document could throw an exception and render a red cross, if a pluggable widget tried to render an image in a too small space. (Ticket 172756)
* We fixed a crash that could happen when opening an app, because Studio Pro stored an inconsistent window layout upon closing an app or exiting the application. (Ticket 173472) 
* We fixed an issue where an argument of an *On change* action that was mapped to a snippet parameter could give an error dialog when trying to deploy the app. (Ticket 174249)
* We fixed an issue in offline navigation profiles where retrieving an object that has a generalization to a base entity type results into returning the base type instead of the specialized type that has been retrieved. (Ticket 174251)
* We fixed a crash that could occur when dragging a Microflow parameter on top of a flow. (Ticket 174341)
* We fixed an issue where a microflow data source inside a snippet could give an error dialog when trying to deploy the app. (Ticket 174462)
* We fixed an issue where passing an object from a pluggable widget data source as an argument to a nanoflow data source could cause an error if the nanoflow tried to change an attribute of the object. (Ticket 174605)
* We fixed an issue where moving a widget out of a data container would show an error dialog if it is configured for conditional visibility based on an attribute from the data container. (Ticket 174758)
* We fixed an issue with switching to "None" option in close pages of "Show page" microflow activity. (Ticket 174834)
* We fixed a bug in XPath constraints for widget data retrieval.
* We fixed incorrect column sizes in Performance Bot panel after fixing an issue by a recommendation
* We fixed an issue in published OData services where serialization would stop when an error occurred, with no way for the client to discover that. Now there is an error appended to the resulting json.
* We fixed an issue that could cause an exception in rare cases during conversion of apps with a workflow.
* We fixed the display of tooltips on disabled context menu items.
* We fixed an issue that error checking would not finish correctly. Because of this outdated errors could still be visible in the Errors pane after fixing them. Also, the progress bar and text message in the status bar of Studio Pro would stay visible until a new change was made.
* We fixed an issue in published OData services where you could specify _Write to database_ when publishing an external entity, which would always result in a runtime error. Now the _Write to database_ option is no longer available for external entities.
* We fixed an issue in Performance Bot Recommendation dialog for MXP006 when checkbox "Delete the microflow after converting" was enabled while Fix button was disabled.
* We fixed an error that could appear when switching documents in the App Explorer.
* We fixed an issue in published OData services where comparing a number with null resulted in 400 Bad Request.
* We fixed an issue in published OData resources using a microflow for insert, update or delete. Clients that had access to the service and the entity would be able to perform the operation even when they did not have access to the microflow. Now the runtime returns `403 Forbidden` in such cases.
* We fixed an issue in consumed OData services where retrieving an external entity with XPath `[NULL = NULL]` (or an XPath using variables with the same effect) would result in an error.
* We fixed an issue causing the user-agent string in runtime statistics to be malformed.
* We fixed an issue in Performance Bot Best Practices MXP003, MXP007 where they were recommending indexes on external entities.
* We fixed an issue in Performance Bot Best Practices MXP014 "Microflow CRUD placement" where it can failing for some apps.
* We fixed an issue where inserting a pluggable widget into a page or snippet could sometimes result in an error dialog.
* We fixed an issue where setting a dynamic classes expression on an element which does not support it (such as a Page) would cause an error dialog while checking the project for errors.
* Also for published OData services, we fixed an issue that would reveal the existence of attributes to which the user does not have access, when they try to update such an attribute with an incorrect value. It now returns the message "Property '_HiddenAttribute_' not found.", just like when the attribute would not exist.
* We fixed an issue in Studio Pro when deploying your app where errors could occur in some scenarios, including when you started deploying while the initial error check was still running after opening the app.

### Deprecations

* Starting with version 11, we will drop support for `mx.logger` client API. Since version 9.22 this API will be warning users to switch to the `window.console` logging functions.
* We dropped support for the following database versions that are no longer supported by the vendors:
  * MariaDB 10.2
* In Mendix 9, a new merge algorithm was introduced that supports fine-grained conflict resolution. We now deprecate the old merge algorithm, which will be removed in the next major version.
