## 9.16.0 {#9160}

**Release date: July 26th, 2022**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "9.16.0" %}}

### New Features

* MxAssist Performance Bot can now be run from the cross-platform [mx command-line tool](/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/) via `mx check --performance`.
* We added the new best practice **MXP015** for MxAssist Performance Bot, which finds XPaths that are not optimally ordered around their `and` statements or their `[]` parts. [**TW: doc link?**]
* Workflows can now be hot-redeployed when locally testing the app (like pages).

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We improved the issue where the initial focus of a dialog box occurred too late after (for example, after you had already selected another control to edit), which meant the selection was lost. (Ticket 144438)
* Finding usages of documents and elements (for example, entities, attributes, and enumeration values) is now significantly faster. This should be especially noticeable when working with large apps.
* When adding new elements (for example, modules, documents, entities, and attributes) to very large apps, Studio Pro is now more responsive.
* We have improved the performance of switching between editors when the **Toolbox** is not visible.
* The performance of editing domain models in large apps has been significantly improved.
* We have improved the responsiveness of the search in **Go to** dialog box.
* We have reduced the memory consumption of Studio Pro when working with a large number of pages in **Design mode**.

#### Other Improvements

* In the import mapping, created objects are now stored in the runtime state. When performing a retrieve activity in **Find by key** or **Call a microflow** within the import mapping, these objects are included in the result.
* We added a preview width for layout grids in the page editor. This width is only used for the visualization inside **Structure mode** and does not affect the width in the running app. It can be useful when the automatically calculated sizes of columns are not representative enough, especially when they are set to **Auto-fill** or **Auto-fit content**.
* External entities are now selectable as a **WorkflowContext** entity.
* Non-persistable entities are now excluded from the MxAssist Performance Bot **MXP014** recommendation.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where retrieving associated objects does not return any objects after import mapping when the associated objects are not committed. Ticket #126464
* We fixed an issue where merging in a branch with a different set of languages did no update the language selector in the status bar. (Ticket 133651)
* We fixed an issue in Studio Pro where clicking Cancel on the credentials popup for downloading a consumed OData service's metadata would show an error.
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro could freeze after long usage. (Ticket 148287)
* We fixed an issue where module roles disappear after re-opening and canceling the module security dialog.
* We fixed an issue where "Limit to current tab" of the **Errors** pane had impact on the "Limit to current tab" of the **Find Results** pane. (Ticket 151088)
* We fixed the search for XPaths (Find Advanced > Xpath) which did not always find all of them. (Ticket 144720) 
* We fixed an issue in XPath constraints on external entities that have a non-filterable key. XPath constraints filtering on those id's now give a consistency error.
* We fixed the search for XPaths (Find Advanced > Xpath) which did not always find all of them. (Ticket 144720)
* We fixed an issue where in restricted markets studio pro would still try to send analytics in some cases.
* We fixed an issue in consumed web service using WS-Addressing. The runtime now also sends the MessageID, ReplyTo and To fields in the SOAP header. (Ticket 148522)
* We fixed an issue where "Date/time" and "Log node" columns were not resizable in Console pane and ConsoleLog application. (Ticket 152104)
* We fixed an issue where import object mapping would return the wrong exception when data or security validation failed. (Ticket 146620)
* We fixed an issue where changing the `selectableObjects` attribute of an association property in the XML definition of a pluggable widget did not require the widget to be updated, causing the widget to misbehave in the client.
* We fixed an issue where an error during file retrieval would cause the runtime to close the connection before sending an error response.
* We fixed an issue where changes in **Properties** were not recognized when directly clicked on "Rerun locally". (Ticket 147385)
* We fixed the tab navigation behavior in data grids. (Ticket 147578)
* We fixed an issue where Performance Bot displays incorrect total count in panel icon when some recommendations have been suppressed.
* We fixed an issue when read-only text controls receive focus on tab navigation.
* We fixed an issue that changes to the page layout of Workflow Admin Pages and Usertask Pages were not applied after hot-redeploy of the page changes.
* We fixed an issue with Performance Bot Best Practice MXP013 where some access rules could cause the inspection to end without outputting results.
* We hide the auto-completion popup of text editors when the containing dialog is resized, moved, or deactivated by the user (i.e. the user switches
to a different application, such as the browser). (Ticket 145062)
* We fixed an issue where usages of **Enumeration** values were not found when used as default value or as a part of **Sequence flow**. (Tickets 99092, 108104)
* We fixed the tab navigation behavior in tree controls.
* We improved Logic Bot behavior when there is a network issue, reducing the number of network calls attempted.

### Deprecations

* We deprecated `IDataTable.getRows().clear()`.
* We fixed an error that appeared when opening PWA application in offline mode on Android (Ticket 153297)
* We fixed an issue when adding an access rule while creating an entity caused an invalid consistency error. (Tickets 146865, 150646)
* We changed the order in which published and consumed service types appear when you are about to add them in Studio Pro. 
* We made additional optimizations on top of 9.12 to further improve client performance of data sources returning many items. (Ticket 126837)
* We fixed an issue where selecting an entity over association in the data source wizard resulted in a consistency error.

### Breaking Changes

* We've added a new consistency check, which shows an error when a widget contains conditional visibility settings for module roles that aren't in the same module. This can happen when a document (e.g. page / layout / snippet) has been moved to another module while containing widgets which are set to be only visible for selected module roles. We added the check because moving such a document will create hidden module dependencies and ends up in an unsupported state. To fix the error, the widget visibility needs to be updated by reselecting the allowed roles in the visibility settings.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
    * Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.
