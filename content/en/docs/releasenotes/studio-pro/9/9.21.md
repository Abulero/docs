### New Features

#### Multiple Snippet Parameters

With this release we made re-using UI simpler and more powerful. Followed by support for multiple page parameters, we now added support for multiple snippet parameters! You can now pass multiple parameters to a snippet call, just as you can with pages, microflows and nanoflows. Inside a snippet, you can select attributes from a parameter directly or create data views which use a parameter or its associations. And next to that, the parameters can also be used in expressions without the need for a data view.

Just like page parameters, snippet parameters are created automatically when you select an entity for the *Context* data source of a data view inside a snippet. You can also use the *Parameters* button in the top bar of the page editor to change the parameters of a snippet manually.

Thank you [Bart Rikers](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/profile/overview/43347) for mentioning this on the [Idea forum](https://forum.mendix.com/link/ideas/1938)!

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We decreased the time it takes to rename an entity and corresponding associations.

#### Other Improvements

* We added a new method to the Runtime API to set the workflow parameter context object
* We have improved the modeling experience when moving or copy-pasting a widget that uses an attribute. In many situations, there is only one available entity for which the selected attribute (path) is valid and the widget can therefore be reconfigured automatically. This prevents unnecessary consistency errors that would need to be fixed manually.
* Rules can be used to make validation microflows using the Validation Assist 
* In the workflow settings we changed the text of the following settings: "Parallel Workflow executions" to "Workflow instance threads" and "Parallel task executions" to "Microflow threads".
* In the workflow settings we removed the cap on the amount of Workflow instance threads and Microflow threads.
* We've added the option to copy styling of a widget. Allowing copying the inline styles, (dynamic) classes, and (applicable) design properties to other widgets.

##### Git version control [REMOVE]

* New apps created in Studio Pro or in the Developer Portal will by default be created with Git as version control system. You can still choose to create an app in SVN.
* For apps using Git as version control system the "Update" command has been renamed to "Pull", which is more common Git terminology.
* If pushing your changes to the server fails because you first have to pull and merge changes from the server, you no longer get an error, but an information message describing the steps to take instead.

### Fixes 1

* We fixed a known issue where Pane navigation dialog is not closed after releasing `Ctrl` key if the `Microflow` editor, `Page` editors or the `Properties` pane is focused. (Ticket 163193)
* We fixed an issue in published OData services where resources with keys other than `id` would give an error when the client left out the key from the `$select` clause. (Ticket 171726)
* We fixed an issue when editing a scss file and closing the editor with unsaved changes. (Ticket 171763)
* We fixed an issue where creating a deployment package on the cloud fails for an app with OTA (Over-the-air updates) enabled. (Ticket 169390)
* We fixed an issue where a popup could be closed even though a blocking progress bar was being displayed. (Ticket 168238)
* We fixed an issue where certain data or actions could not be retrieved/executed because of conditional visibility. (Ticket 168875)
* We fixed an issue where thumbnail is not deleted when the image associated with the thumbnails is deleted. (Ticket 171367)
* We fixed an issue where searching Date and time values with Range Search Field could filter dates wrong (Ticket 147935)
* We fixed an issue in workflows where an enumeration-based decision with an empty option failed if the empty path was not the last position.
* We fixed an issue in published OData services, where using a single quote to address an object would cause an error to occur.
* We did several improvements in log subscribers:
  * Log message format has been unified for FileSubscriber, ConsoleSubscriber, LoggerSubscriber and SyslogSubscriber
  * When logging an error, the log message and the exception stacktrace are now printed as a single log entry
  * Improved internal error handling
    * If FileSubscriber detects an infinite logging loop while logging an internal error, it stops using the Logging API and writes the error into a `.err` file. The `.err` file is saved to the same directory with the regular log file.
    * All other subscribers do same but write the error to [stderr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_stream)
* We now support deleting an external object and then creating a new object with the same key.
* Validation Assist works correctly with external entities: instead of committing them there is Send External Object action for such entities in a generated microflow
* We made the Console grid sortable.
* We added support for the functions `replace(expression, pattern, replacement)`, `lower(expression)`, and `upper(expression)` to OQL.
* In the microflow editor, we now allow you to filter microflow actions on specific ways to process lists, like `Union`, `Sum`, or `Sort`, to make it easier to select the right list action type.


* Signing in using your default browser is now the only way to sign in with Studio Pro.
* We fixed an issue when publishing an entity in an OData service in Studio Pro. This would sometimes cause consistency error CE6624 (a validation rule is required) for entities that do not allow validation rules, such as system entities and external entities.
* We fixed an issue in consumed OData services which caused an error when filtering on boolean attributes in a data container widget.
* We fixed an 'ObjectDisposedException' that happened occasionally upon closing the 'Entity' dialog.
* We fixed an issue where a snippet call without a snippet selected would throw an error in some cases.
* We fixed a UI issue where the workflow editor in dark mode shows incorrect icons and uses incorrect colors.
* We fixed an issue that caused a consistency error when generating user task pages with only one outcome.
* We fixed an issue with proxy authentication when a locale or language pack other than 'English' were used on the user's machine.
* We improved how Performance Bot Best Practice MXP012 finds the committed variables and also handles logically empty loops.
* When using a String (in ISO 8601 format) or Integer/Long (milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970) in the OQL functions DATEDIFF and DATEPART, they are now converted to a Date and time not only when the function is used in the WHERE clause, but also in the SELECT clause.
* When duplicating or copying workflows, pages set on user tasks would get cleared which resulted in consistency errors. Instead, set user task pages do not get cleared anymore.
* We improved the user task properties by swapping the location of the default option of the who can access configuration.
* We fixed an issue that prevents published OData services from properly handling update and delete requests if the exposed entity is not persistable.

### Deprecations

* We have deprecated the `Core.retrieveXPathQuery` methods in the Java API. Please use `Core.createXPathQuery` instead.
