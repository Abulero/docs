## 9.17.0 {#9170}

**Release date: August 30th, 2022**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "9.17.0" %}}

### New Features

* We added the ability to [link an association property to a data source](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#datasource). This allows an association property to access values from a list of objects instead of the context object of the widget, similar to linked attribute properties. We have also enhanced the [filtering API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-client-apis-list-values#listvalue-filtering) for data sources to include support for associations. When combined with the [selectableObjects](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#xml-attributes) attribute of the association property, this feature enables widget developers to build powerful filtering options for data sources based on the value of an association.
* We introduced a mechanism for app users to change the state of running workflows. It enables running workflows to jump to different activities, which are selected by the user. It also enables users to fix workflows in an incompatible state (for instance, when a current activity has been removed). For this functionality, we introduced the **System.WorkflowJumpToDetails**, **System.WorkflowCurrentActivity**, and **System.WorkflowActivityDetails** entities in addition to the [Generate jump-to options](/refguide/generate-jump-to-options/) and [Apply jump-to option](/refguide/apply-jump-to-option/) microflow activities. You need the [Workflow Commons](/appstore/modules/workflow-commons/) module version 2.3.0 or above to use this functionality. For more information, see [Jumping to Different Activities in a Workflow](/refguide/jump-to/).
* We have extended OData capabilities in Studio Pro, allowing you to [wrap services, APIs, and databases with OData](/refguide/wrap-services-odata/) and making it easier to [build connectors](/appstore/creating-content/connector-guide-build/) that access external data. The OData services can then be easily discovered and used in the [Data Hub Catalog](/data-hub/data-hub/catalog/). The new features include the ability to [publish non-persistable entities as OData resources](](/refguide/wrap-services-odata/#npe-published-odata), and to [use microflows to define how resources should be retrieved and stored](/refguide/wrap-services-odata/#odata-data-sources). We also provide an [OpenAPI](/refguide/published-odata-servies/#openapi) contract to easily [test published OData resources](/refguide/wrap-services-odata/#testing).
* In the styling editor, we added file and folder operations such as create, rename, and delete. Simply right-click a file or folder to see the available options. [**TEAM SLACK, ASK DEV**]

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We have optimized editing performance in the domain model when using custom images for entities. Entity images are now selected from the disk rather than from an image collection, and they have got stricter dimensions and format requirements (64x64 PNG). A previously selected entity image can be optimized automatically by right-clicking the deprecation in the **Errors** pane.
* We have resolved a memory leak and optimized memory usage for text editors and various text controls (for example, the multi-line text box). Memory is now propely released upon closing the dialog box that contains those controls.
* We have also resolved a memory leak and optimized memory usage for dialog boxes  containing the grid control (for example, the **Access Rules** dialog box).
* When working with large apps, Studio Pro is now more responsive when doing the following:
    * Finding unused items
    * Renaming or deleting domain model elements
    * Finding externally used microflows and nanoflows
* We have improved the performance of resizing dialog boxes that contain the expression and XPath editors.
* We reduced a delay that occurred when collapsing a node in a tree (for example, in the App Explorer).
* We made saving all documents via closing all tabs, closing your app, or using **Save All** faster.
* We have significantly improved responsiveness when switching between editors.

#### Other Improvements

* Nanoflow calls with an unused return value now result in a warning. (Ticket 152208)
* We adjusted MxAssist Performance Bot best practice [MXP014](/refguide/performance-best-practices/#mxp014) to be more conservative when recommending and with improved loop support.
* We removed the old **My Apps** from the **Preference** settings. [**CREATE PR**]
* We upgraded the embedded database HSQLDB to version 2.7.0.
* We upgraded PostgreSQL driver to version 42.4.1.
* When object IDs are created at a high rate, they are now reserved in batches larger than the regular size of 100.
* Dialog box title bars now have unified behavior (for example, disabled buttons are hidden) and appearance in both light and dark modes (only the colors are different).
* Microflow parameters are now automatically named when you drag them onto the canvas.
* We added the **Move up** and **Move down** buttons to the **Entity Access Rules** and **Module Security** > **Entity Access** tabs.
* You can now indicate whether published OData resources are countable or not.
* Studio Pro now provides an OpenAPI contract for published OData services.
* We added an option to the [mx check](/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/#check) command of the mx tool to use an exported suppressed-warnings file instead of the local app settings.
* We added a consistency check on the use of reference sets in the association property of a pluggable widget, which is not supported in an offline profile.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where deploying an app in the cloud would crash because of the presence of certain SVG images. (Ticket 137710, 124792, 129288, 133070)
* Fixed an issue with microflows that were using a RESTCall but not storing the result in a variable. (Ticket 152439)
* Fixed an issue where Decimal values would be displayed in exponential notation (for example 0E-8). (Ticket 153332)
* We fixed an issue where images in import & export mapping documents were not shown as a thumbnail. (Ticket 120289)
* We fixed an issue in published REST services, where the runtime would respond XML to clients requesting `Accept: */*` or `Accept: application/*`. The runtime now responds with JSON to such requests.
* Equality and inequality comparisons in XPath and OQL now work symmetrically. (Ticket 153729)
* We fixed an issue where a reference selector as the first input element on a page wouldn't get the focus when the page is first loaded. (Ticket 153456)
* We fixed an issue where, in a multinode environment, unique constraint violation would result in a wrong error message.
* We fixed an issue regarding startup synchronization in offline-first PWA and native apps, where we made startup synchronization more reslient against object changes that are no longer compatible with the new domain model changes. This fix prevents the app startup from failing when such an incompatibility is detected and thus a better user experience. To prevent data-loss, the incompatible objects will be synchronized to the runtime as `System.SynchronizationError` objects (with the corresponding files if any) and application's admins can process and restore these data if they wish.
* We fixed an issue which caused unnecessary warning popups to appear in the Make it Native app when running in development mode. (Ticket 148162)
* We fixed an issue where the workflow editor did not open when a user click the workflow-related consistency error in the **Errors** pane.
* We fixed an issue which caused the properties of a custom widget to appear in the wrong order in Studio Pro after updating the widget. (Ticket 154455)
* Fixed an issue with the pow expression in a nanoflow when the exponent is not an integer number. (Ticket 153289)
* We fixed an issue where calling a microflow with "Apply entity access" enabled in the background would fail if retries were used.
* We fixed an issue where temporary files used for image rotation were not being closed. (Ticket 154992)
* We fixed an issue where pinned client certificates were not correctly initialized. (Ticket 153824, 162332) 
* We fixed an issue when a microflow action property dialog is opened via keyboard, it was sometimes immediately closed. (Ticket 152306)
* We fixed the situation when enabling entity access on generated data source microflow for the task page would fail with an exception.
* We fixed an issue where duplicated entries were getting generated in the WorkflowUserTaskDefinition system table. (Ticket 140353)
* We fixed an issue in native mobile applications where clicking a Save button would send not editable objects to be committed.
* We fixed an issue where `mx.ui.back()` was no longer working. (Ticket 155179)
* We fixed an issue is published OData services where resources using pagination and clients using `/$query` syntax with `$skip` and `$top` would sometimes result in the wrong objects being returned. (Ticket 155302)
* We fixed an issue which caused a list view with an XPath data source to show incorrect results if it used variables in its XPath constraint and a controlling custom widget (ListViewControls, AutoLoadMore or GridSearch) was present on the same page. We improved the consistency check on the use of XPath variables to disallow this combination, but only if the custom widget is actually controlling that specific list view. (Ticket 154306)
* We fixed an issue for native mobile platform in which a ListView widget that has an XPath datasource that is configured with an entity path over an association, did not correctly apply the constraint(s). (Ticket 153011)
* We fixed an issue when copying and pasting data from a grid that rows not visible are not copied.
* We fixed an issue where changes to the current user would not be immediately reflected on a page after a refresh, for example language changes.
* We added back type names for the 'for each' and 'while' loop microflow actions in the logging. These are 'ListLoop' and 'WhileLoop' respectively.
- We fixed an issue which caused a list view with an XPath data source to show incorrect results if it used variables in its XPath constraint and a controlling custom widget (ListViewControls, AutoLoadMore or GridSearch) was present on the same page. We improved the consistency check on the use of XPath variables to disallow this combination, but only if the custom widget is actually controlling that specific list view. (Ticket 154306)
* We fixed an issue where custom widgets wouldn't load when having an override for the base URL with the "appbase" option in "dojoConfig". (Ticket 162168)
* We fixed an issue for a workflow where an enumeration-based decision with an empty option failed if the empty path was not the last position.

### Deprecations

* Custom image for an entity can be selected from disk instead of an Image Collection.
* We fixed an issue where importing multiline values in **Import from Excel** of **Batch Translate** returns error "source not found". (Ticket 153290)
* We fixed an issue where closing the dialog editing an entity within the Published REST services activates the service pane. (Ticket 152412). 
* We fixed an issue where it was no longer possible to import an XML Schema file with Windows-1252 encoding in Studio Pro. (Ticket 150833)
* We fixed an issue where a popup layout based completed user task was still visible in the task inbox.
* We fixed an issue that the app-level on-state-change handlers for a workflow were not executed for the workflow instances which workflow definition is removed from the app (and also not when those incompatible workflows were aborted after that).
* We introduced a workaround for decimal-pad keyboard disabled comma issue in Samsung devices, allowing the user to type a dot which will be replaced by a comma if the locale uses comma as the decimal separator. (Ticket 116581, 155339)
* We made offline synchronization resilient to file documents with broken/no content on the server. Previously, such file objects caused the entire synchronization to fail. The client will ignore and exclude such objects from synchronization. (Ticket 153344)

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
    * Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.
