## 9.19.0 {#9190}

**Release date: October 25th, 2022**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "9.19.0" %}}

### New Features

* We introduced a Java API to interact with the Workflow Engine. See the javadocs for details. [**TW**]
* We added a new workflow activity named **Call workflow** that enables calling a sub-workflow from within a workflow. This allows you to split your workflows into smaller reusable workflows.

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We resolved several event leaks caused by menu items and UI element identifiers.
* When working with large apps, the error-checking process is now faster.
* The splash screen is now shown earlier after starting Studio Pro.
* We optimized **Toolbox** performance when using custom images for exposed actions. You can automatically optimize previously selected exposed action images by right-clicking a deprecation in the **Errors** pane.

#### Other Improvements

* We improved the way we handle the completion of workflow user tasks. The selection of a specific user task is no longer required when selecting an outcome. This way, both the microflow action and the client action **Complete user task** can be reused for different user tasks that share the same outcomes.
* We now support resizing in the **App Security** dialog box.
* We added **Move up** and **Move down** buttons to the **Entity Access Rules** and **Module Security Entity Access** tabs. [**TW**]
* We revamped the window that allows you to select which attribute and associations are exposed from published web service parameters and return entities. This also now supports dark mode.
* We improved the way published OData services return error messages. They now include a list with error details, which provides more information on which specific properties caused any errors.
* We now show the consumed OData services on the **Data Hub** pane regardless of whether you are logged in.
* You can now choose [more than one key attribute](/refguide/published-odata-resource/#select-attributes/) for a published OData resource.
* * In the list of attributes and associations for published OData resources, we removed the **Part of key** column and replaced it with a key icon. [**TW**]
* We added an option to the `mx check` of the **mx tool** to use an exported suppressed-warnings file instead of the local app settings.
* We made it possible to configure the default editing mode for pages. You can now go to **Preferences** > **Work Environment** tab to choose whether the page editor should open in structure mode or design mode by default. [**TW**]
* The MxAssist Performance Bot best practice MXP014 now presents recommendations grouped by microflow and by entity. This enables supressing by entity as opposed to suppressing the entire microflow.
* MxAssist Performance Bot no longer blocks the UI. [**TW**]
* We added a **Duplicate** button in the **Generate Validation Microflow** form.
* We extended the list of supported buttons for [Validation Assist](/refguide/validation-assist/). Now, a validation microflow can be generated for a button, **Save** button, and **Call microflow** button.
* We added three new metrics to the Runtime Server task queue:
    * `mx.runtime.stats.taskqueue.queue-wait-time` (with the tag `queue` as the queue name) – for timing the time between task creation (or scheduling) and pickup of the task for execution
    * `mx.runtime.stats.taskqueue.queue-active-threads` (with the tag `queue` as the queue name) – for gauging the amount of active queue threads over time
    * `mx.runtime.stats.taskqueue.task-execution-time` (with the tag `queue` as the queue name and `task` as the task name) – for timing the execution time for a task

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where changing the content of a file and re-uploading it did not reflect the changes, as the unchanged version was still uploaded. (Tickets 164543, 153955)
* We fixed an issue where published OData services returned error messages from microflows in an incorrect JSON format.
* We fixed an inconsistency in the error codes that were returned by published OData services.
* We fixed an issue where keyboard shortcuts were not working in the **Properties** pane.
* We fixed an issue that occurred when trying to debug Swagger UI served as interactive REST documentation by Mendix Runtime. The JavaScript and CSS files refer to a source map, and now, Mendix Runtime also serves that source map.
* We fixed an issue where system members (such as `owner`, `changedBy`, createdDate, and `changedDate`) could not be selected on **Filter** and **Find** list operations in a microflow. (Ticket 151436)
* We fixed an issue with the generate expression for changing an association on an object. (Ticket 163183)
* We fixed an issue where the periodic updating of sessions threw exceptions. (Ticket 162216)
* We fixed an issue where uploaded images were not rotated in the upright position based on the orientation information in the image metadata. (Ticket 155278)
* We upgraded OpenJDK to 11.0.16.1+1 in the Studio Pro installer. (Ticket 164386)
* We fixed an issue where the attribution report generated an empty file.
* We fixed an issue where selection in a data grid or a tree control did not reset if you selected multiple rows and clicked on the same row that had the selection earlier.
* We fixed an issue where a non-editable cell in a data grid was focused upon tab navigation.
* We fixed an issue in published OData resources where publishing a non-persistable entity without a read microflow did not show a consistency error and caused a runtime error.
* We fixed an error that appeared when a dialog box showed a validation error after closing.
* We added back the type names for the **For each** and **While** loop microflow actions in the logging. These are `ListLoop` and `WhileLoop`, respectively.
* We fixed an issue in external entities that had keys consisting of more than one attribute, where if the service returned those attributes in a different order than the app expected, it stored them in that order.
* We fixed an issue where historical dates that were stored in a non-localized date attribute were off by several seconds in certain timezones. (Ticket 165972)
* We fixed an issue where scrolling in the tile view of the **Toolbox** exhibited irregular behavior.
* We fixed an issue where the minus sign did not display when using Arabic languages. (Ticket 144779)
* We fixed an issue in the documentation served by Mendix Runtime (for example, `/rest-doc`) where the font defined in the stylesheet did not load.
* We fixed a some small issues where your avatar image (or a default image if you did not have an avatar) did not show correctly after signing in.


* We fixed an issue where the justifyCenter design property did not work with the Scroll Container native widget. The design property now works with the widget. (Ticket 145729)
* We fixed an issue where documents would be renamed unnecessarily when copying or moving them from one module to another.
* We fixed an issue where the error style did not work with the Reference Selector, Date Picker and Drop-Down native widgets. (Ticket 130360)
* We fixed an issue where Import Mapping with JSON and using Custom Range would not take into account the specified Amount. (Ticket 132368)
* We fixed an issue where Range value was not taken into account when importing JSON with Import mapping action. (Ticket 132368)
* We fixed an issue where Logic Bot fails to create Delete Object recommendation for an old microflow that has duplicate variable names.
* We fixed an 'ObjectDisposedException' that happened occasionally upon closing the 'Entity' dialog. 
* We fixed an issue which caused incorrect sorting behaviour on external entities from a consumed OData service, when trying to order by an associated property.
* Applying the OQL ROUND function to an expression of Decimals now returns a BigDecimal instead of a Double. (Ticket 162214)
* We fixed concatenating multiple strings with non-strings using the + operator in OQL.
* We've made the 'Edit Template Parameter' dialog resizable again.
* We fixed an issue where runtime reports errors related to Amazon S3 storage even though the application is not using Amazon S3 storage backend. (Ticket 166921)
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would show an error message when clicking the magnifying glass icon in the Find Results table.
* We fixed an issue where a machine name with non-ASCII chars would block the user from sign-in. (Ticket 165552)

### Known Issues

* When you navigate between dockable panes using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> while in the microflow editor, page editor, or **Properties** pane, releasing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> does not close the pane-selection dialog box. (Ticket 163193)
    * Workaround: Use <kbd>Enter</kbd> or a mouse click to close the dialog box.
