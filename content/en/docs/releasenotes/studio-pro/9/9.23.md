### New Features

* We have released a new feature named **Machine Learning (ML) Kit**. The ML Toolkit enables deploying an ML model (built using a common ML framework and language) into Studio Pro runtime in a low-code way. For more information, see [](). [**TW**]
* We implemented a lock/unlock workflow feature as two microflow activities. If a workflow is locked, then the workflow does not allow for new instances to be created. [**TW**]
* We also introduced the workflow lock/unlock functionality to the [Runtime API](https://apidocs.rnd.mendix.com/9/runtime/index.html). You can now lock and unlock workflows through Java actions.

### Improvements

#### Internationalization Improvements

Previously, when creating a widget, for example, its caption was set in English (US) and Dutch. This caused the following issues in multi-lingual applications:

* When you were creating your app in English (US), Dutch texts were created "under the hood." If you then decided to start translating your app into Dutch, it was unclear which texts had been intentionally translated and which had been generated upon creation.
* When you were editing your app in a language other than English (US) or Dutch, you saw the default text between pointy brackets (for example, **\<Button\>**), because the text was not available in that language after creation. [**VERIFY FORMATTING ON**]

Now, we only ever initialize the active language. Also, Studio Pro will no longer suggest Dutch texts, only English. (Tickets 76899, 151149, 152504)

#### Other Improvements

* We added the option to define the return variable name for Java and JavaScript actions.

* We improved the message that appears when one page loading supersedes another page. (Ticket 173586)
* We added support for the language Tigrinya, Eritrea. (Ticket 176908)
* We added copy/paste functionality to the workflow editor.
* Mon-persistable entities can now be created entirely client-side as long as they have no virtual attributes or create event handlers.
* Consumed OData services now support the use of OData 4.01 syntax to specify `@count` and `@nextLink`.
* We added a feature to export MxAssist Performance Bot recommendations to a CSV file.
* We added a new option to the **Edit** > [Find Advanced](/refguide/find-and-find-advanced/#find-advanced) option to search for all pages with a page URL. [**TW**]
* We improved the output for the  [mx tool](/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/) when it is used to find performance recommendations.
* The index selector and the published OData key selector in Studio Pro now both respond to double-clicking.
* MxAssist Performance Bot Best practice [MXP011](/refguide/performance-best-practices/#mxp011) has been extended to detect nested data views as well as list views.
* We cleaned up supported AWS S3 credential providers.
* In published OData services in Studio Pro, the security group is now hidden when [app security](/refguide/app-security/) is off.
* When using integrated security to connect to SQL Server, we now automatically set the authentication scheme to JavaKerberos when not running on Windows.
* We improved the guessing of the attribute type that occurs when adding new attributes. Several names will now be guessed correctly, such as **HouseNumber** and **Rate**. Studio Pro also stops suggesting names after you have picked a specific enumeration.
* We improved the grid for HTTP headers (in published OData services, consumed OData services, Call REST activity, and Call web service activity) and the grid for published OData attributes. They now ask for confirmation when you click **Delete**. The **HTTP Headers** grid now also allows for multi-selection so that you can easily delete more than one header.
* Published OData services now take into account that AutoNumber attributes cannot be empty. That means that an AutoNumber attribute is a good choice for a key, and that Studio Pro will not suggest adding a required validation rule.
* We improved the handling of changes done to non-persistable entities so that they are only validated once. This should improve cases where a change has to be validated with an external service.
* We improved the way Studio Pro turns singular entity names into plurals. This happens, for example, for the entity set name of a published OData resource. Studio Pro now initializes irregular plurals such as "Entities" and "People" correctly. It is still possible to change the value the Studio Pro comes up with to whatever you like.
* We added a **Work Offline** button to the login dialog box shown on startup.
* When sharing usage data is disabled, a **Send report** button is added to the dialog box shown when an unexpected error occurs. This allows you to send a report about the crash to Mendix.
* When signing in with an untrusted certificate, Studio Pro now shows a dialog box asking if you want to accept the certificate. When this happened previously, you could not sign in.
* It is now possible to use `exists` expressions in XPath queries with external entities.

### Fixes

* <a id="177724"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.22/#ki-177724) that caused attribute widgets (such as a [text box](/refguide/text-box/)) to not trigger a consistency error if the attribute was not configured, which caused an error when deploying the app. (Tickets 177724, 178455, 178570)
* We fixed an error where opening multiple pages consecutively on app start was resulting in an infinite progress bar. (Ticket 76175)
* We fixed the issue where an error could occur while running the application when XPath expression was used in a validation rule for a DateTime attribute. In such cases a consistency error will be displayed inside Studio Pro. (Ticket 128395)
* We fixed an issue where a reference selector with an XPath data source using a *Constrained by* condition incorrectly cleared its value if it was inside a data view listening to a widget and the selection of that widget changed. (Ticket 162340)
* We fixed an issue with import mapping, where object value from parameter cannot be changed. (Tickets 162408, 170669)
* We fixed an issue where a newly created object displayed in the client could not be retrieved over association in a microflow. (Ticket 170969)
* We fixed an issue where pluggable widgets (such as Data grid 2) with a microflow or nanoflow data source would sort an AutoNumber attribute alphabetically instead of numerically. (Ticket 172287)
* We fixed an issue where the "Repeats" column in the Find advanced results for Scheduled Events was giving the incorrect result. (Ticket 172665)
* We fixed an issue in external entities where XPaths combining `not` with an association would result in an exception. (Ticket 172747)
* We fixed an error that might appear when the user clicks fast on a tree control cell. (Ticket 172770)
* We fixed an issue which caused an error in the runtime and the client if a pluggable widget was retrieving data over association which was not accessible for the current user. (Ticket 173477, 173663)
* We fixed an issue when copy-pasting an input widget into a page created using a page template triggers exception. (Ticket 174252)
* We fixed an issue where a text template with fallback text caused an error in the client if the data container of the template was a snippet. (Ticket 175898)
* We fixed an issue when resizing performance bot configuration dialog, the contents did not adjust correctly. (Ticket 176133)
* We fixed an issue where list view search did not work anymore if an AutoNumber attribute was included in the search. (Ticket 176396)
* The process of opening an app in Studio Pro is now more robust: we fixed the potential issue that, when opening an app fails, opening another app after that could also result in an error even when there is no problem with the second app itself.
* We fixed an issue when counting external objects for OData services that support query segment. This would result in a POST request to the `/$count` endpoint, which is incorrect. Now all count queries use `?$count=true&$top=0` (OData 4) or `?$inlinecount=allpages&$top=0` (OData 3).
* We fixed sizes of Caption and Validation Message textboxes in New/Edit validation rule for Validation Assist
* We fixed an error that might appear when scrolling down the Find Results data grid. 
* We fixed a crash that could occur when updating the metadata of a Consumed OData Service editor, and then browsing for a file on disk.
* We fixed an issue where the Synchronize Database dialog is cut-off at the bottom, making the dialog's buttons unreachable.
* We fixed an issue with the key selection form for published OData services. Previously, the 'Key' field on the 'Edit published resource' form would incorrectly remain empty after selecting key attributes.
* We fixed an issue which caused an association property of a pluggable widget to malfunction if it was linked to a data source and configured with more than one association step.
* We fixed an issue in JSON Structure where user was unable to format the json string using the Format button. 
* We fixed an issue in the object ID generation that could result in a NullPointerException when the database is not accessible.
* We fixed an issue in the Studio Pro user interface of the [Call REST Service activity](/refguide/call-rest-action/), where changing the HTTP method to GET would not clear the request section, so variables used in the body would still show up as being used by it.
* We fixed an issue with using a Retrieve Workflow Context microflow activity when the type of the workflow context object is a specialization of the workflow parameter entity
* We fixed the issue in the Microflow editor that selecting the 'Go to page' context menu item on a 'Show Page' activity would result in a crash when no page is selected yet.

### Deprecations

* Deprecated internal use only methods which were previously exposed in the public API.
