## 9.15.0 {#9150}

**Release date: June 28th, 2022**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "9.15.0" %}}

### New Features

* We added the **On change behavior** property to the **Text area** widget, this property lets users select how **On change** is handled.
* We added support for one-way navigable associations, which allow navigation to associated entities in a single direction: from parent to child.
     * One-way navigable associations  have an icon indicating the type and navigability of associations to the entity properties and **Add Association** dialog box. 
     * One-way navigable associations have a special informational banner in the association properties dialog box.
     * One-way navigable associations are represented by a dashed arrow in the domain model editor. There is also an indicator reflecting the direction of its navigability.
* We added the dark mode support for the **Module Security** dialog box.
* We added the **Annotation** activity to workflows. For more information, see the [General](/refguide/workflows/#general) section in *Workflows*.
* We added the **Autofocus** property to the **Text area** and **Text box** native widgets. When set to true, the widget receives the keyboard focus when the page is loaded. 

### Improvements

* We changed the way error responses for requests to published OData services are formatted. When the client does not specify an `Accept` header, the `Content-Type` is `application/json`, where it used to be `application/xml`.
* We fixed the JSON representation of errors in published OData services. The error code is now a string instead of a number.
* We simplified how to select the metadata from a file or URL for a consumed OData service in Studio Pro.
* Failed workflows can now be aborted.
* We improved the user feedback on the workflow client actions in case the action can not be performed based on the state of the data. In those cases a more descriptive (and translatable) pop-up message is shown to the end-user explaining the problem instead of the generic "An error has occurred, please contact your System Administrator" message. The corresponding microflow actions will still throw exceptions in those cases (although the messages are using the same translatable texts).
* MxAssist Logic Bot now always shows a parameterized list for the **Loop through a list**, **Change variable**, and **Create variable** recommendations.

#### Performance Improvements

* Performance of editing domain models in large apps was significantly improved.


### Fixes

* We fixed issues where changes in a document did not propagate to documents that are dependent on it. This resulted in error messages not showing up or not disappearing until you run the app.
* We brought back switching between consequent tabs of the open documents using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Page Down</kbd>. As a bonus, it is now also possible to switch to a particular tab using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>-<kbd>0</kbd> where 1 till 0 is the position of the tab. (Ticket 147599)
* We fixed an error that appeared when closing a dialog box with the [X] button while changing a grid value. (Ticket 146714)
* We fixed a problem where Autonumbers would increment twice if the `DataStorage.QueryPlan` lognode was set to `TRACE`. (Ticket 149016)
* We fixed an issue where the reference selector placeholder color was not set correctly.
* We fixed an issue where **OK**, **Cancel**, and **Help** buttons were constantly "shaking" in the **Application Security** dialog box.
* We fixed an issue where a drop-down list was opening outside the parent dialog box.
* We fixed an issue with deploying apps with microflows that had an expression over a system association (such as *System.owner*).
* We fixed a deadlock error that occurred in the task queue for scheduled events when using SQL Server. (Tickets 148524, 149049, 149073, 149354, 149687)
* We fixed a Runtime exception when using XPath constraints comparing Boolean expressions, e.g. `[(Attr1 > 42) = (Attr2 < 7)]`.
* We fixed an issue when adding an access rule while creating an entity caused an invalid consistency error. (Tickets 146865, 150646)
* We made additional optimizations on top of Mendix 9.12 to further improve client performance of data sources returning many items. (Ticket 126837)
* We fixed an issue where selecting an entity over association in the data source wizard resulted in a consistency error.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
    * Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.
