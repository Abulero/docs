## 1 Introduction 

Mendix Studio and Mendix Studio Pro will be fused in one IDE in Mendix 10. Starting from Mendix 9.21, Mendix only features Studio Pro, meaning that Mendix 9.20 is the latest version you can use for Studio. For more information on fusion, see the [Coming in 2023: The Merging of Studio and Studio Pro](https://www.mendix.com/blog/coming-in-2023-the-merging-of-studio-and-studio-pro/) blog post.

Therefore, we are encouraging Studio users to switch to Studio Pro before Mendix 10 GA. This document outlines the steps the Studio developer needs to take to install Studio Pro, know their way around it, and start developing with it.

## 2 Migrating from Studio to Studio Pro

1. [Download and install Studio Pro](/refguide/install/). From Studio, you can initiate the download by clicking the **More Options** icon > **Edit in Studio Pro** in the top menu bar.

    Consider downloading the same Mendix version for Studio Pro as your Studio app has. To view the Mendix version of your Studio app, click the **More Options** icon > **About**.

2. After you downloaded and installed Studio Pro, sign in to Studio Pro with your Mendix credentials. 

3. Find and open your app from the list of apps:

Now you can learn your way around Studio Pro and start developing with it. For more information on Studio Pro UI, see [Studio Pro Overview](/refguide/studio-pro-overview/).
