## 2 Company Profile

The Company Admin can edit various company details on the **Company Profile** tab, such as **Company name**, **Contract person**, and **Logo**.

## 3 Company Admins

On the **Company Admins** tab, the Company Admin can add, edit, or remove a Company Admin.

For more information, see [How to Manage Company Roles and App Roles](/developerportal/howto/change-roles).

## 4 Company Settings

On the **Company Settings** tab, the Company Admin can change the password expiration settings (number of days). To do this, set the password expiration (in days) and click **Save**. Note that a value of zero or lower indicates that passwords never expire.

The Company Admin can also view the company email domains. This is important for verifying the domains of Mendix users assigned to your company. If the domain list contains incorrect domains or does not contain some of your company's email domains, contact [Mendix Support](mailto:support@mendix.com).

## 5 Launchpad Settings

On the **Launchpad Settings** tab, the Company Admin can select the background image for the [Mendix launchpad](https://home.mendix.com/home/).
