## 1 What Is the Developer Portal?

The [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) is one of the three key components of the Mendix Platform. The other two are [Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling) and [Mendix Studio](/studio/index). In the Developer Portal, Mendix developers can collaborate, deploy, and manage their apps, and manage their company and users. 

The Developer Portal also offers open, well-defined APIs, enabling third-party developers to integrate their own widgets and plugins. For more information, see [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/).

You can go to any part of the Developer Portal using the menu items in the header:

These menu items are described below.

Or, you can turn on the **New Navigation** option via the menu beneath your profile avatar:

In this navigation, you can access different parts of the Mendix Platform  via the icon on the very left of the toolbar:

In this navigation, you can access the following:

* **Mendix Home** – the [Apps](#apps) page
* **Studio Pro** – the [Studio Pro](/refguide/index) download page in the [Mendix App Store](/appstore/index)
* [Control Center]()
* [Buzz](#buzz)
* **Cloud Portal**  – the [Deployment](/developerportal/deploy/) facilities of the Developer Portal [**VERIFY: use of "Cloud Portal" at all - which leads to required change in PNG but enables using it in other docs; whether "Cloud Portal" reflects the destination, and how - this is the bigger issue**]
* [App Store](/appstore/index)
* [Data Hub](/data-hub/)
* [Academy](#academy)
* [Docs](#docs)
* [Forum](#forum)
* [Community](#community)

On the very right side of the toolbar, you can search and access your [Mendix Profile](/developerportal/mendix-profile/). You can also click this icon to create a new app:

## 3 Buzz {#buzz}

In the company [Buzz](collaborate/buzz), you can communicate with colleagues, App Team members, stakeholders, and any other Mendix users in your company:
