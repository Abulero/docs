## 1 What Is the Developer Portal?

The [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) is one of the three key components of the Mendix Platform. The other two are [Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling) and [Mendix Studio](/studio/). In the Developer Portal, Mendix developers can collaborate, deploy, and manage their apps, and manage their company and users. 

The Developer Portal also offers open, well-defined APIs, enabling third-party developers to integrate their own widgets and plugins. For more information, see [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/).

## 2 Navigation

On the right side of the toolbar, you can search and access your [Mendix Profile](/developerportal/mendix-profile/). You can also click the **+** icon to create a new app.

On the left side of the toolbar, you open an access menu by clicking the **Switch-to** menu:
