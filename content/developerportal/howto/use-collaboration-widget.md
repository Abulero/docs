## 1 Introduction

The new Mendix Collaboration Widget enables you to collaborate more easily and quickly then ever before when developing an app project. With this widget, you make use of the fully integrated feedback cycle functionality as well as access editing capabilities in the Web Modeler, preview the app you are working on via the Mendix mobile app, and share the app.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Use the widget for leaving feedback on an app, editing an app, get a mobile preview of an app, and sharing an app
* Configure the Mendix Collaboration Widget

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Create an app containing a working application model

## 3 Leaving Feedback on an App

When you click the **Feedback** icon, the platform checks if you are signed in first. If you are already signed in, you will be in **Feedback Mode** right away. If you are not signed in, to enter the in **Feedback Mode** you will need to either sign in (although you do not have to enter your name on the feedback) **[VERIFY: ACCURATE, HOW WORKS?]** or continue as a guest.

Once you are in Feedback Mode, you can click anywhere on the screen to leave a comment.

And voila! Your feedback will go straight to the **Feedback** page of your app project in the Developer Portal. For more information, see the [Reviewing Feedback in the Developer Portal](gathering-user-feedback#reviewing) section of *How to Use the Mendix Feedback Widget*.

## 5 Phone Icon

When you click the **Mobile share** (phone) icon on the widget, a pop-up window will be displayed that allows you to see how  your app will look inside a PhoneGap wrapper:

You can gain this mobile view by installing the [Mendix mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendix.SprintrMobile) on your device and then scanning the QR code in the pop-up window. The app you are working on will then be displayed on your mobile device.
