## 1 Introduction

When you have created your app, it is important to be able to manage it. The **Operate** section of the Developer Portal allows you to look at the app's performance and to ensure that data is backed up and can be restored under your control.

Access to operations information is divided into four pages:

Metrics, Alerts, and Logs are not available for Free Apps running in the Mendix Cloud, and you cannot make manual backups.

The four operations pages are described below.
