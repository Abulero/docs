## 1 Introduction

There are a number of functions related to licensed app nodes which you need to request outside the Developer Portal.

These functions, listed below, are described in this document.

* [Requesting a New Licensed App Node](#new-node)
* [Resizing an Existing Environment](#resize)
* [Offboarding an Environment](#offboard)

## 2 Requesting a New Licensed App Node{#new-node}

If you want to deploy your app to a new licensed node in the Mendix Cloud or on-premises/virtual private cloud, you can request one from Mendix Support.

Fill in all the required details for this new licensed app node in the [Request New App Node](https://newnode.mendix.com/) app.

Mendix Support will contact the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/app-roles/index#technical-contact) for the app via a ticket in the [Mendix Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com), and provide the app details. Mendix Support will also check if your request matches your entitlement to resources (number of apps, cloud resources).

## 3 Resizing an Existing Environment{#resize}

If your environment is not the right size, for example it has too little database storage, you can request a resize from Mendix Support.

Fill in all the required details in the [Resize Environment](https://resize.mendix.com/index.html) app.

Mendix Support will contact the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/app-roles/index#technical-contact) for the app via a ticket in the [Mendix Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) to discuss priority and timing.
