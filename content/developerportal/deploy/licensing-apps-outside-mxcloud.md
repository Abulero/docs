## 1 Introduction

Mendix gives you the opportunity to build **Free Apps** which give you the opportunity to try things out and to build and test apps using all the functionality of Mendix. You can deploy these to the Mendix Cloud, or to another public or private cloud of your choice, for example SAP Cloud Platform.

However, Free Apps are restricted in how long they run, and how many people can use them. They will stop running after around 2 hours and are limited to ten users.  A full list of restrictions is available in [Mendix Cloud](mendix-cloud-deploy) â€“ note that some of these restrictions are specific to Free Apps running on Mendix Cloud.

To use your app in a production environment, you need to license it. The method for doing this differs depending on the environment to which you are deploying your app.

## 2 Obtaining a Mendix License

## 3 Mendix Cloud

To run Mendix apps in production on the Mendix Cloud, they must be linked to a licensed node in the Mendix Cloud. This process is described in a separate document: [Licensing Mendix Cloud Apps](licensing-apps).

## 4 SAP Cloud Platform

## 5 IBM Cloud Portal

## 6 Siemens MindSphere

## 7 Cloud Foundry

## 8 Kubernetes

## 9 Windows Server

To license Mendix on Microsoft Windows you need to:

1. Obtain the server id of your server
2. Request a license key from Mendix Support
3. Insert the license key on the server.

Full instructions on how to do this can be found in [MS Windows: Activate a Mendix License on Microsoft Windows](activate-a-mendix-license-on-microsoft-windows).
