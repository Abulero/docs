## 1 Introduction

<!--
For our Studio on Tencent release we need a url that shows the User Management page. In Studio we will use this url for the ‘Manage Users’ button on the Settings page.

As decided earlier, we will not have a real ‘manage users’ page in ATM yet, but this will be a normal documentation page explaining:
* how to retrieve your MxAdmin password from the portal
* how to configure local users in the app (using the Administration module)
-->
