## 1 Introduction

Mendix apps can be deployed to many different platforms. Much of the deployment and management of a Mendix app depends on which platform it is deployed to. You can find information about each platform in the sections of documentation which relate specifically to that platform.

There are, however, a number of issues which are related to all, or several platforms. Rather than duplicate the information, these are covered in this section of the documentation.

The subjects covered in the *General* section of deployment are:

* [Secure Outgoing Connections from your Application](securing-outgoing-connections-from-your-application)
* [Two-Factor Authentication](two-factor-authentication)
* [Version Downgrade Prevented](version-downgrade-prevention)

## 2 Managing Your Deployed Apps

For a number of different platforms, the **Deploy** category in the Developer Portal allows you to deploy and manage your app.
