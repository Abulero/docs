## 1 Introduction

{{% alert type="warning" %}}
The AppCloudServices module has been deprecated. Enabling single sign on with your Mendix account is now managed by the MendixSSO module. Please see [Mendix Single Sign-On](mendix-sso) for more information.

This documentation is only meant for users with legacy applications which still use AppCloudServices.
