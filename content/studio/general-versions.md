## 1 Introduction 

In Mendix Studio, you will be prompted to upgrade to the latest **Mendix version** whenever a new Mendix version becomes available. Next to that, Studio has its own version and will be upgraded automatically (for example, on a daily basis). This document explains how these two versions relate to each other and what you can do to make use of the latest greatest features of the Mendix Platform along with Studio.

The **Mendix Studio version** is a build of the Studio user interface. 

The **Mendix version** is the version of the app project you are editing. A new **Mendix version** contains a new version of Mendix Studio Pro.

The **Studio version** and the **Mendix version** can be viewed by clicking the info icon **About** in the top-right corner of Studio.

## 2  Upgrading to the Next Version

The **Studio version** is updated continuously (even daily), which will provide you with the latest user interface features for editing your app. However, when there is a new **Mendix version**, an orange top-bar is displayed, informing you that you can upgrade your app to the next version.

Automatic upgrade will not be offered in Studio when moving from Mendix 7 to Mendix 8, as Mendix 8 contains changes that cannot be upgraded automatically using the regular Studio upgrade mechanism. For more information, see the [Upgrading to Mendix Version 8](general-upgrade-to-8) section below.

This means that when you upgrade, you upgrade your app to a new **Mendix version**. When you see the upgrade notification, you can either stay on the current version and continue working (although you might not have the newest Mendix Platform features and improvements), or you can upgrade to the newest version.

Once you have upgraded to the newest version, you cannot revert the upgrade. Also, anyone working on the app using Studio Pro must use the new version of Studio Pro from that moment on.

### 2.1 Upgrading to Mendix Version 8

Mendix version 8 brings many improvements to the platform and opens up new app building capabilities to Mendix developers. However, this release contains changes that cannot be upgraded automatically using the regular Studio upgrade mechanism. 

This means the following:

* Existing apps built in Studio will remain on the latest release of Mendix version 7.23 
* Newly created apps in Studio will have Mendix version 8 from the start

Developers wanting to upgrade their Studio apps to Mendix version 8 can only do so in Studio Pro or by involving developers familiar with Studio Pro. For more information on upgrading apps using Studio Pro, see [Moving from Desktop Modeler Version 7 to Studio Pro 8](/refguide/moving-from-7-to-8).

Automatic upgrade will not be offered in Studio when moving from Mendix 7 to Mendix 8.  However, if your app has Mendix 8 beta version, it will be upgraded to Mendix 8 automatically.

Note that apps with version lower than 7.23.7 will still show the orange upgrade bar to upgrade to Mendix 7.23.7 version.

## 3 Postponing the Immediate Upgrade to the Next Version 

Users on the business side and in IT who want to leverage both Studio and Studio Pro to collaborate on the same application may not want to upgrade right away (for example, because upgrading Studio Pro may not be desired until later).

Also, specific company policies may be in place for approving software upgrades.

The latest **Studio version** supports a range of recent **Mendix versions** â€“ a bundle. While we encourage users to upgrade to a new Mendix Studio Pro version as soon as possible, in many cases it is possible to postpone the upgrade and still make use of the latest Studio features.

Even when you are editing an app that is not upgraded to the latest bundle, Studio in many cases will still be available for use. An older version of Studio will automatically be loaded when you open this project in Studio. This Studio version will not contain the latest Studio features, but it will still allow you to edit the app. For more information on the latest changes to Studio, see the [Studio Release Notes](../../releasenotes/studio).

{{% alert type="info" %}} 

Studio has a minimum supported **Mendix Studio version**. This means that if the version of your project is lower than the minimum supported version, the upgrade is obligatory; otherwise, you will not be able to work on your app in Studio.
