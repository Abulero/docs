## 1 Introduction

Workflow is a visual language in Mendix Studios that allows you to build extendable processes. It is fully integrated with other visual languages, such as the microflow editor and page editor. 

To view the workflows of your app project in Studio, click the **Workflows** icon in the left menu bar:

Workflows is a visual way of expressing application logic. A workflow looks like a flow chart. On a new workflow a *start event* (a starting point of the workflow) and an *end event* (an endpoint of the workflow represented by a *red* dot) are created by default. You can various activities to a flow of a workflow that is called a *path*.
