## 1 Introduction 

In Mendix Studio, you work with data in various ways. 

You can control what data is shown on pages and microflows using [data filters](data-filters).

If your organization has a Data Hub license, you can connect external data from other apps in your organization to your app and use this data locally. For more information, see [Data Hub in Studio](data-hub-in-studio). 

Studio offers a possibility to build an app using your own data. For that you need to use the **App from a spreadsheet** template where you can import a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. For more information on the App from a spreadsheet, see [Starting With Your Own Data](start-with-data).
