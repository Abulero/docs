## 1 Introduction 

Collaboration is an important concept of Studio. 

You share your app model changes with your team members automatically, both with Studio and Studio Pro users. This process is called [collaborative development](collaborative-development). 

You can also leave comments and collaborate with your team members in the [Buzz](collaboration-buzz) pane.
