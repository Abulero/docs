## 1 Introduction 

Collaboration is an important process in Mendix Studio. 

You can work together with your team members on one project in Studio and Studio Pro. The changes to your app model will be shared and synchronized automatically. This process is called collaborative development. For more information, see [Collaborative Development in Studio](collaborative-development).

You can also collaborate with your team members while creating the app and leave comment and create feedback items in the **Buzz** pane. For more information, see [Buzz](collaboration-buzz).
