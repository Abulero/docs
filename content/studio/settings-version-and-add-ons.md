## 1 Introduction

The **Mendix Version & Add-Ons** screen provide information on the Mendix version and add-on modules your app currently has and allows you to upgrade them when a newer version is available.

Mendix version is the core version of your app that contains main features and functionality. For more information on Mendix and Studio versions, see [Studio Ranges & Mendix Versions](general-versions).

Add-ons are additional modules that provide content to certain features, such as security or workflows. For example, the Administration module allows you to manage local app users and view app statistics. 

## 2 Upgrading to the New Mendix Version 

When a new Mendix version comes out, you will see a green dot next to the screen in the side-bar menu. Click the **Upgrade Now** button to upgrade to the next version.

## 3 Updating Add-Ons

Once there is a new version of an add-on module that is compatible with your app, you will see the **Update** button next to it.  Click it to update the add-on module. Sometimes modules depend on each other, for example, the latest version of the workflow-specific module Workflow Commons might need the latest version of the Data Widgets module. Studio detects such dependencies automatically and notifies you about them. You can only update all dependent modules together for your app to work consistently.
