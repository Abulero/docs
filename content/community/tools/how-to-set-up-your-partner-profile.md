## 1 Introduction

The purpose of the Partner Profile is to provide the Mendix community and customers with a transparent overview of each partner company's knowledge, skills, experience, reviews, and culture. The profile is a simple and clear way for each partner to present themselves through an aggregated view of the developers in the organization, including the number of certified developers and their average Mendix Level [**Mendix Level - still acucrate?**]. It is also possible to add projects, customer reviews, contact information, a company video, and a description to each profile.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Set up and edit the Mendix Partner Profile
* Add projects to the profile
* Add developers to the profile

## 7 Editing Team Members

This section presents information on adding the most valuable assets of your company: your certified Mendix developers. Before you can add a developer to the Partner Profile, their Community Profile needs to be set to public (for details on how to do this, see [How to Set Up Your Community Profile](how-to-set-up-your-profile).

To add developers to the Partner Profile, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the **Developers** tab, where all the certified Mendix developers in your company are shown:

    ![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/team-members.png)

    You can use the **Sort by**, **Search**, and **Certification Level** features to find a specific team member.

2.  Select the active team members within your organization whose certifications you want to be visible on your Partner Profile by clicking **Add to profile**. The certification of each developer added to the profile will be visible in the statistics in the profile header, where numbers for **Rapid Developers**, **Advanced Developers**, **Expert Developers**, total **Mx Developers** (all developers added to the profile), and total **Mx Developers** (all existing developers) are displayed.

    Only the certifications and points of the added developers will be counted in the Partner Profile. The highest rank of certification will be added to the overview, and the points will be added to the average Mendix Level of all your developers.

    [**Verify - still necessary?**]

{{% alert type="info" %}}

Make sure you offboard the developers who no longer work at your company through the company administration in the Mendix platform. These former employees will still be visible in the overview. It is important that you deactivate these developers in the Developers Portal so that they don’t have access to projects.

## 8 Editing Testimonials

## 10 Sorting on the Partners Overview Page

[**Verify: is this section still acucrate? Any info still necessary?**]

The [Meet our partners page](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/openid/login?immediate=true&continuation=link/partneroverview) presents all the partners in the Mendix community. The sorting is based on a combination of the following KPIs:

* Project ratings (PR) – the average rating of all the testimonials on your projects

    ![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/overall.png)

* Certified developers (CD) – the total amount of certified developers 
    * Please note that developers with multiple certifications count as one certified developer

     ![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/certified.png)

* Mendix Level (ML) – based on the average points of the developers added to the public Partner Profile
    * We use the average points instead of the Mendix Level because this will result in an more granulated sorting
    * For details on points and the Mendix Level, see [Become True Mendix Blue](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/faq)

    ![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/level.png)

* The number of reference projects (RP) – the number of reference projects are also part of the sorting formula

For the sorting, Mendix normalizes the KPIs of all partners to a score between 0 and 1 by following this formula:

* *(Partner Value – Minimal Value) / (Maximum Value – Minimum Value) = New KPI Value*

For example, your company has 14 certified developers (CD). The biggest company has 40 certified developers (maximum value), and the smallest company has 1 certified developer (minimum value):

* CD of biggest company KPI value – *1*
* CD of smallest company KPI value – *0*
* CD of your company KPI value – *(14 - 1) / (40-1) = 0.33*

The following formula of the normalized KPI values of the company defines the sorting order between the partners:

* *PR + (2 x CD) + (0.5 x ML) + RP*
