## 1 Introduction

So you’ve decided to check out your new Mendix Community Profile page, but you've found it suspiciously empty. Don’t worry, we're here to help you set up your profile so you can show the world what a real Mendix developer looks like!

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Set up your Community Profile
* Make your profile public
* Merge your accounts

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Sign up for Mendix [here](https://www.mendix.com/try-now/)

## 3 My Profile

**[ADJUST HEADINGS VIA FINAL CONTENT]**

To access your [Community Profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/profile), hover over your picture on the right side of the navigation bar and select **My Dashboard** from the context menu.

**[LINK NAME ABOVE GOING TO  CHANGE?]**

### 3.1 Overview

Your profile will open to the **Overview** tab. In the header of your profile, you see your personal information (which is also presented on the **Personal Info** card). These details can be easily edited to present accurate personal details, project roles, and skills you have gained. Click the **Settings** cog icon to edit your job function and biography. The header also presents your location, number of [connections](#connections), Mendix points, [credits ](#credits), and [badges](#badges).

Below the header, the first card you see presents your **Stats**. The chart and its legend display your points divided between various Mendix products and activities. For details on gaining points, see the [Points System FAQ](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/faq). When analyzing your points, be sure to also check out the [Leaderboard](#leaderboard) card on this tab to see the top Mendix community contributors!

The tabs of your Community Profile are described below.

### 3.2 Badges {#badges}

In addition to the **Stats** chart, on the **Overview** tab you can gain an overview of your **Badges**, which represent your achievements and progress on the Mendix Platform. You can see your **Badges in Progress** as well as **Next Badges**. The badges are color-coded based on their rarity, from green (least rare), to blue, purple, and orange (most rare). You can see all of your badges on the **Badges** tab of your profile. And for all the details on the badges—which will help you determine which next badges you can work towards—check out the [Badge Overview](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/badges).

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/badges.png)

### 3.3 Challenges

The **Challenge** card lists activities you can complete on the Mendix Platform to gain various Mendix badges and credits. The platform suggests the best order for your challenges, but you can complete these activities in any order you like. The activities you complete and badges you gain are pushed to the top of the card, so you can see what you still have to do. Once you complete a challenge, you get a **Challenge** badge. **[STILL ACCURATE?]** 

There is also a featured challenge on your profile. The featured achievement presents a [multi-level badge](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/badges) you can strive to win by working on the Mendix Platform and completing certain tasks. The header will always feature the next badge level for you to work towards. **[STILL EXISTS?]**

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/challenges.png)

<a name="credits"></a>Clicking **View all** will bring you to the **Challenges** tab of your profile, which gives you more details on your challenges and credits. For each challenge, a certain amount of credits can be gained, with which you can claim rewards.

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/challenge-example.png)

In the **Prizes you can claim** section, you can see a list of rewards you have gained by completing challenges and gaining credits. Click **Claim Reward** **[ACCURATE?]** to claim your prize. Click **View Shop** to go to the Mendix shop and see all the sweet Mendix swag on offer!

Completing your challenges and gaining badges is a great way to stay engaged with the Mendix community. And there are always new prizes available!

### 3.4 Connections {#connections}

One of the greatest strengths of Mendix is our awesome developers community, and the **Connections** card is the perfect place to start networking with fellow developers and Mendixites. When you are invited by a Mendixite to connect, you can check out their profile and make a decision to accept or ignore the invitation. **[IGNORE OR REJECT?]**  You can also see a list of people you may know so that you can add further connections to your profile.

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/connections.png)

Clicking **View All** on the card will bring you to the **Connections** tab. On this tab, you can invite friends and colleagues to Mendix in two ways:

* **Share URL** – copy the personalized invite link and share it on your personal website, blog, and social media channels, or share it directly via specific social media
* **Send invite** – send someone a Mendix invite by entering their email address and clicking **Send invite**

**[STILL ACCURATE BELOW, OR HOW DOES THIS WORK NOW?]**

After you click **Invite Friends**, a pop-up window titled **Get your free t-shirt** appears. There are two tabs available here. On the **Share URL** tab, you can copy the personal invite link that is provided and then share it on your personal website, blog, and social media channels to invite more people to Mendix. On the **Send invite** tab, you can send someone a Mendix invite by entering their email address and clicking **Send invite**. 

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/referral.png)

You will earn some Mendix swag with five successful invites!

**[BELOW STILL NECESSARY?]**

After you have invited someone to Mendix, click **Invite Friends / View Status** to see their name and status listed at the bottom of the pop-up window. Their status is determined via these steps:

1. If you invited them via email, they will first get the **Invited** status.
2. When they click **Sign up for Mendix** and receive a confirmation email, they will get the **Confirmation e-mail sent** status.
3. When they complete the guided product introduction tour in the Mendix Web Modeler, their status will change to **Successful**.

Once five of your referred users reach the **Successful** status, you will see the **Claim your t-shirt** link on your dashboard. Click this to fill in some details and receive your awesome Mendix t-shirt. Yay!

One more thing about Mendix invites – when you invite someone and they sign up for Mendix, they will receive a voucher for the [Mendix Rapid Developer Certification Exam](https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/certification/rapid) that is valid for six weeks. So encourage your friends to try something new and get certified by Mendix!
