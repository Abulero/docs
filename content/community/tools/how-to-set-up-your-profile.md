## 1 Introduction

**[VERIFY NAMING: Profile, MxProfile, Mendix Profile, Community Profile, Developer Profile]**

Your Mendix Profile is your main point of contact with members of the Mendix community. It is the page that displays your activities on the Mendix Platform as well as details about your life and background. There are plenty of ways to get more involved with the Mendix community, and your profile is a great starting point!

To access your Profile, hover over your picture on the right side of the Developer Portal navigation bar and select **My Profile** from the context menu.

**[VERIFY LINK NAME CHANGE - MY PROFILE?]**

## 2 Overview Tab

**[REVIEW BELOW]**

Your profile will open to the **Overview** tab. In the header of your profile, you see your personal information (which is also presented on the **Personal Info** card). These details can be easily edited to present accurate personal details, project roles, and skills you have gained. Click the **Settings** cog icon to edit your profile. This will take you to the edit mode, where you can edit your job function, biography, skills, industries, social media accounts, password, API keys. The header also presents your location, number of [connections](#connections), Mendix points, Mendix level, [credits ](#credits), and [badges](#badges).

Below the header, the first card you see presents your **Stats**. The chart and its legend display your points divided between various Mendix products and activities. For details on gaining points, see the [Points System FAQ](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/faq). When analyzing your points, be sure to also check out the [Leaderboard](#leaderboard) card on this tab to see the top Mendix community contributors!

The tabs of your Community Profile are described below.

## 3 Badges {#badges}

In addition to the **Stats** chart, on the **Overview** tab you can gain an overview of your **Badges**, which represent your achievements and progress on the Mendix Platform. You can see your **Badges in Progress** as well as **Next Badges**. The badges are color-coded based on their rarity, from green (least rare), to blue, purple, and orange (most rare). You can see all of your badges on the **Badges** tab of your profile. And for all the details on the badges—which will help you determine which next badges you can work towards—check out the [Badge Overview](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/badges).

## 4 Challenges

The **Challenge** card presents a featured challenge you can complete on the Mendix Platform to gain credits. Once you complete a challenge, you can claim the credits and use them in the MxShop.

**[UPDATE SCREENSHOT]**

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/challenges.png)

<a name="credits"></a>Clicking **View all** will bring you to the **Challenges** tab of your profile, which gives you more details on your challenges and credits. You can complete these activities in any order you like.

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/challenge-example.png)

Click **Claim Credits** **[VERIFY BUTTON NAME, GET NEW SCREENSHOT]** to claim your credits.

Completing your challenges and gaining credits is a great way to stay engaged with the Mendix community. And there are always new items available in the MxShop!

## 5 Connections {#connections}

One of the greatest strengths of Mendix is our awesome developers community, and the **Connections** card is the perfect place to start networking with fellow developers and Mendixites. When you are invited by a Mendixite to connect, you can check out their profile and make a decision to accept or ignore the invitation. You can also see a list of people you may know so that you can add further connections to your profile.

To connect with someone, click the plus icon.

**[DOCUMENT SENDING AN INVITE]**

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/connections.png)

Clicking **View All** on the card will bring you to the **Connections** tab of your profile. On this tab, you can invite friends and colleagues to Mendix in two ways:

* **Share URL** – copy the personalized invite link and share it on your personal website, blog, and social media channels, or share it directly via specific social media
* **Send invite** – send someone a Mendix invite by entering their email address and clicking **Send invite**

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/referral.png)

You will earn some Mendix swag with five successful invites!

**[VERIFY HOW BELOW IS BUILT]**

After you have invited someone to Mendix, click **View Status** to see their name and status listed at the bottom of the card. Their status is determined via these steps:

1. If you invited them via email, they will first get the **Invited** status.
2. When they click **Sign up for Mendix** and receive a confirmation email, they will get the **Confirmation e-mail sent** status.
3. When they complete the guided product introduction tour in the Mendix Web Modeler, their status will change to **Successful**.

Once five of your referred users reach the **Successful** status, you will see the **Claim your t-shirt** link on your dashboard. Click this to fill in some details and receive your awesome Mendix t-shirt. Yay!

## 6 Leaderboard {#leaderboard}

This card on your profile presents a selection of Mendix developers with the highest points.

**[UPDATE SCREENSHOT]**

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/leaderboard.png)

Clicking **View all** takes you to the **Leaderboards** page, which presents all the boards available for viewing Mendix Platform user activity: **Top Overall**, **Top Forum**, **Top App Store**, **Top Platform**, **Top Community**, and **Top Learning**.

To earn points and climb the leaderboards, start performing different activities in the Mendix community. For example, let's say you have some time to spare while your app is deploying. You get a cup of coffee and check out the [Mendix Forum](http://forum.mendix.com). One questions pops out because you came across a similar problem a few weeks back. You decide to help the community member and post an answer to their question. Not long after, the author marks your answer as accepted. Boom! 15 points right there.

Check out the tables below which describe how to earn points.
