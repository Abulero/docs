## 9 Merging Your Accounts

Since the release of the Community Profile, you can merge your old Mendix account(s) into your current Mendix account. This action combines all your hard-earned points, certifications, and achievements in your efforts to climb the leaderboards.

There are five quick and easy steps to merge your accounts:

1. Go to your [Community Profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/ownprofile/).
2. Click **Make my profile public** to make your Community Profile public (for more information, see [6 Making Your Profile Public](#MakingYourProfilePublic)).
3. Click **Account Settings** on the right side of the screen.
4. Under **Merge your accounts**, enter the email address of the account you want to merge with your current account.
5. Click the send button to send a merge request.

We’ll take things from there, and the email address of the merged account will be shown in the list when the accounts have been merged:

With this action we only combine the accounts. We don’t deactivate the old account(s). This should be done by that company’s administrator.
