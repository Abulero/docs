## Main Mendix Products

These are branded Mendix product names, but they do not always need  "Mendix" in front of them in the documentation.

### Mendix App Store

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances, even when just writing "App Store."
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Cloud

There are two versions of Mendix Cloud, v3 and v4. For details on how to refer to these, see [version (Mendix Cloud)](#version-mxcloud) below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Developer Portal

This term is used on the **My Apps** screen in Studio Pro.

This term replaces "Sprintr," "Platform Portal," and "Mendix App Platform." These terms are not to be used in the product UI or documentation. For more information, see the [Outdated & Incorrect Terminology](#outdated) section below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
The Developer Portal includes what is sometimes referred to as the "Cloud Portal," which is not an official term and is not used in the product UI or documentation. If you want to refer to deployment facilities in the Developer Portal, refer to the **Environments** section of the Developer Portal or emphasize the action of "deploying an app to the Mendix Cloud."
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Platform

Describes Mendix as a product and encompasses all products released by Mendix (as in, Studio Pro, Studio, Developer Portal, etc.).

For more information, see the [Outdated & Incorrect Terminology](#outdated) section below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize "Platform" when used in "Mendix Platform."
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="success" %}}
This is the power of the Mendix Platform.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="success" %}}
The platform includes Mendix Studio and our cloud hosting.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Studio

The rebranded name for the Web Modeler as of Mendix 8.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
"Studio" can be used where regular repetition is necessary in a doc. However, where possible, "Mendix" should be added to the product name.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Studio Pro {#pro}

The rebranded name for the Desktop Modeler as of Mendix 8.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
"Studio Pro" can be used where regular repetition is necessary in a doc. However, where possible, "Mendix" should be added to the product name.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Studios

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Where you are describing a feature applicable to both Mendix Studio and Studio Pro, use "Mendix Studio and Studio Pro." However, after you introduce the names of both products once and need to refer to both of them together again, you can use "the Mendix Studios."
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
When you need to use one general product name in a diagram, it is okay to use just "Studios."
{{% /alert %}}

## Mendix Terms

This section contains the main Mendix terms that are used in the product UI and documentation.

### app

An app can be one of the following:

* A local application
* A [Free App](#free-app)
* A licensed application hosted on the Mendix Cloud; another cloud such as AWS, SAP Cloud, or IBM Cloud Portal; or on the user's own server

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use "app" or "application" when referring to apps in general. Do not capitalize (meaning, do not write "Mendix App").
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
The full word "application" has a more well-rounded meaning to it (as in, web and mobile apps), whereas "app" may connote just mobile app to the reader. Accordingly, it can be better to use "application" at the beginning of documents and then switch to "app" later on. We want to make it clear that Mendix is not just for building mobile apps, but all kinds of applications.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
It is useful to differentiate "app" from "app project" when referring to what the user works on for project management in the Developer Portal. For more information, see [app project](#app-project) below.
{{% /alert %}}

### app project {#app-project}

"App" should be used instead of "project" as much as possible in the documentation. However, be aware of the potential confusion here when referring to what the user works on for project management in the Developer Portal. Our understanding is that a "project" includes the app being developed itself as well as resources from the Developer Portal, deployment, and elsewhere. Thus, "app" cannot entirely replace "project" in the documentation. 

{{% alert type="info" %}}
"App project" should be used to clarify project management-related tasks in the Developer Portal.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="success" %}}
Enter the email addresses of all the co-workers you want to invite to your app project.
{{% /alert %}}

### App ID

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Always capitalize.
{{% /alert %}}

### App Team

The people and roles invited to work on an app project.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize, because **Team** is capitalized in the Developer Portal.
{{% /alert %}}

### App User

The app end-users invited to use your app.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### AppCloud

This appears in some Mendix Cloud and Developer Portal documentation. It continues in the name of the [AppCloudServices](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/934/) module, which provides single sign-on. (The original idea of AppCloud can be found on [this blog post](https://www.mendix.com/press/new-mendix-appcloud/).)

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use specific SSO-related terminology instead of "AppCloud."
{{% /alert %}}

### Atlas UI

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use just "Atlas."
{{% /alert %}}

### Build Server

Described in the [Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/enterprise-capabilities/platform-architecture).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances of the Mendix Build Server (to parallel "Team Server"). 
{{% /alert %}}

### Business Engineer

This is an app project role. As such, it differs from the term "business developer," which is used in the [Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/) as a generic role and a persona term. Forrester also uses this term.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Buzz

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use "Buzz" on its own, unless you need to specify "Company Buzz" or "App Buzz" to clarify the context.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use "the Buzz" (unless the context demands it).
{{% /alert %}}

### Company Admin

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Company Contact

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Deployment Package Repository

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### fast deploy or fast deployment

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use "insta-deploy" or "instant redeploy."
{{% /alert %}}

### Free App {#free-app}

A Free App is an app that can be deployed without a license and is therefore free. There are restrictions on the resources available to a Free App, and a Free App environment is not the same thing as a cloud environment, as it does not support complex or large applications. Free Apps are part of the [Mendix Free Edition](#free-edition).

For more information, see [Sandbox](#sandbox), a deprecated term for a Free App environment.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Free Edition {#free-edition}

This is the package of offerings that users can employ without requiring a paid license.

This replaced [Community Edition](#community-edition) in 2015, and was made a focus of the announcements at [Mendix World 2019](https://www.mendix.com/blog/a-3-step-leap-into-your-digital-future-highlights-from-mendix-world/).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use to refer to the whole package of Mendix free offerings (Studio Pro, Studio, and Free Apps), not individual parts of the offering.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### guided product introduction tour

Used to describe the user guidance that is built into Mendix Studio. This is a generic term, so it can be applied as more user guidance is built.

It should be qualified by the context/location. In the case of Studio, the generic term is qualified by the context/location in the [Studio Release Notes](/releasenotes/studio/) like this: "A guided product introduction tour is now shown when you select **Start Your First App** from the **Introduction Tour** category when creating an app in the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/)."

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not capitalize.
{{% /alert %}}

### Make It Native app

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize the name of the app ("Make It Native"), but do not capitalize "app."
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Assist {#mendix-assist}

This term replaces "Mx Assistant" and "Mx Assist." These terms are not to be used in the product UI or documentation. For more information, see the [Outdated & Incorrect Terminology](#outdated) section below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix mobile app {#mendix-mobile-app}

[Mendix](/refguide/getting-the-mendix-app) is the name for the mobile app available for developers to test hybrid mobile apps using PhoneGap.

This term replaces "Mendix Developer app" and "Mendix Mobile app." These terms are not to be used in the product UI or documentation. For more information, see the [Outdated & Incorrect Terminology](#outdated) section below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
To avoid confusion with "Mendix" in all its other usages, always use "the Mendix mobile app."

### Mendix Client

The forum is closely integrated with the Community Profile so that Mendix community members can see all the interesting and useful information about who is participating in the forum. It has two tabs:

Capitalize in all instances.

Write generally as "the forum."

### Mendix level

### Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide

Published [here](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/).

Use the full name in the documentation, not just "Evaluation Guide."

### Mendix Profile

The profile of an individual Mendix community member.

Capitalize in all instances.

Use instead of "Developer Profile."

### Mendix Runtime

Mendix Runtime = "Mendix Business Server" + "Mendix Client."

Replaces "Mendix Business Server" and "Mendix Business Engine" as of Mendix 7.

The best practice is to use a definite article for additional clarity: "the Mendix Runtime."

Capitalize in instances referring to Runtime as part of the Mendix product.

Do not capitalize when referring to the generic "runtime" concept.

See Terminology Decisions and Usagebelow for comments on this term under "Mendix Business Server."

### object

Within the domain model, an object refers to an instance of an entity.

For example, the **Location** _entity_ might contain the **Address** _attribute_. A **Location** _object_ would contain a specific address, for example, "268 Summer Street, Boston, MA 0221" or "Gedempte Zalmhaven 4k, 3011 BT Rotterdam."

Also see entity.

### on-premises

When we talk about the physical location of hardware that contains Mendix software, we&##39;re referring to a location, or premises. "Premises" means the land and buildings owned by someone, especially by a company or organization.

"Premise" means an idea or theory on which a statement or action is based. For example, "Your claim that Mendix can&##39;t build apps six times faster than traditional development is based on a false premise."

Do not use "on-premise," "on premise," "on-prem," or "on prem."

On-premises deployment is the process of…

### requirements management

The [Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/app-lifecycle/requirements-intro) specifies "requirements management" (or "Agile requirements management") as embedded in the Mendix Platform and not "project management."

### role

Scrum should always be capitalized.

### SCRUM Master

This is how this role is written in the Developer Portal UI.

#### Sprint

Sprint should always be capitalized.

#### sub-microflow

Spell with a hyphen (even though it is used without a hyphen on the UI).

### Support Portal

The application that is used to submit requests and track tickets. Used by both customers and Mendix employees.

Do not use "Customer Portal" or "Customer Support Portal."

Capitalize in all instances.

### team

### Team Server

Written on top of Subversion and delivered as a plugin to the Developer Portal, the Mendix Team Server is designed to make the life of a Mendix developer easier. Mendix Studio Pro is tightly integrated with the Team Server and actions like creating a new project (including a versioned model repository), updating, committing changes, and merging model versions are all available from within Studio Pro as a single click action.

The Team Server is delivered as a plugin of Developer Portal for a reason: it enables you to manage Team Server access from the Developer Portal, and it enables Mendix to provide you with a revolutionary way to combine requirements, implementation, and feedback! When you commit application model changes to the Team Server from within the Modeler, you can select the user stories (reflecting requirements) that you have been working on. The Team Server will automatically create links between these user stories and the model changes you made, providing you with a way to navigate from commits to the associated requirements. Furthermore, with these links, Mendix creates a link from a user story to a changeset, which can include a link to a form (if you changed a form in the changeset). While feedback also refers to a form, Mendix can create links between feedback, forms, changesets, and user stories.

The Team Server also connects the capture-and-develop phase of the agile application lifecycle. When you start working on the next version of your application, you just open Studio Pro to see the user stories planned for the current sprint and start working on them. If a user story is based on user feedback, you can directly jump to the form mentioned in the metadata of the feedback and start implementing the requested change.

Capitalize in all instances.

### Team Server project

### Technical Contact

The Technical Contact role is responsible for license renewal and is the first point of contact for Mendix Support. A Mendix application will always be set up and delivered with a technical contact assigned to it. The Technical Contact needs an _MxID_ before Mendix can activate a license for an application.

Capitalize in all instances.

#### Theme Customizer

Capitalize in all instances, as this is a Mendix (Atlas UI) product and is capitalized in the UI.

### UI Resources package

When talking about the package that is used, write as "UI Resources."

When talking about the contents of such a package, write "resources."

#### version (Mendix Cloud) {#version-mxcloud}

Use lower-case except when beginning a sentence or heading.

Use _Mendix Cloud_ before the version, except where the context is clear.

**2 Differences Between Mendix Cloud v3 and v4**

V4 has much better security than v3.

### version (Studio Pro and Mendix Runtime)

Either use _Studio Pro 8.1.0_ or _Mendix 8.1.0_. Can also use _version 8.1.0 of Studio Pro_ writing "version" in full.

Do not use lower-case "v" to describe a Studio Pro or Mendix Runtime version – this is reserved for the Mendix Cloud version.

### virtual private cloud

If you&##39;re using a virtual private cloud to manage workloads at AWS or Azure, you can easily deploy Mendix in your VPC to leverage the services and resources from your enterprise account. You can buy Mendix from the AWS or Azure marketplace or bring your own license.

### Web Modeler

This section contains terms that are not used or have had their name changed.

### Cloud Portal

This is an internal term and should not be used in the documentation or publicly, as it has not been agreed on or branded. It no longer appears in the documentation or Evaluation Guide.

This functionality should be described within the name/context of the Mendix Developer Portal(for example, "deployment via the Developer Portal"). If wanting to refer to deployment facilities in the Developer Portal, avoid the use of any "portal" language and emphasize the action of "deploying an app to the Mendix Cloud."

### Community Edition {#community-edition}

For Mendix 5.18 and above the Mendix Community Edition was introduced which included the ability to deploy a Free App. This was replaced by the [Mendix Free Edition (DX Release)](https://www.mendix.com/blog/powering-continuous-innovation-with-the-mendix-free-edition/) in 2015, a move which was reinforced by [announcements at Mendix World 2019](https://www.mendix.com/blog/a-3-step-leap-into-your-digital-future-highlights-from-mendix-world/).
