## Main Mendix Product Names

These are branded Mendix product names. However, they do not always need "Mendix" in front of them in the documentation.

### Mendix App Store {#app-store}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances, even when just writing "App Store."
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Cloud

### Mendix Cloud version {#mx-cloud-version}

There are two versions of Mendix Cloud, v3 and v4.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use a lower-case "v" except when beginning a sentence or heading.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use "Mendix Cloud" before the version, except where the context is clear.

{{% alert type="success" %}}
These are the main differences between Mendix Cloud v3 and v4.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="success" %}}
V4 has much better security than v3.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Developer Portal {#devportal}

This term is used on the **My Apps** page in Studio Pro.

This term replaces "Sprintr," "Platform Portal," and "Mendix App Platform." These terms are not to be used in the product UI or documentation. For more information, see the [Terminology History](#outdated) section below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
The Developer Portal includes what is sometimes referred to as the "Cloud Portal," which is not an official term and is not used in the product UI or documentation. For more information, see [Cloud Portal](#cloud-portal).
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Platform {#platform}

Describes Mendix as a product and encompasses all the products released by Mendix (as in, Studio Pro, Studio, Developer Portal, etc.).

For more information, see the [Terminology History](#outdated) section below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize "Platform" when used in "Mendix Platform."
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="success" %}}
This is the power of the Mendix Platform.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="success" %}}
The platform includes Mendix Studio and our cloud hosting.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Studio {#studio}

The rebranded name for the Web Modeler as of Mendix 8.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
"Studio" can be used where regular repetition is necessary in a doc. However, where possible, "Mendix" should be added to the product name.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Studio Pro {#pro}

The rebranded name for the Desktop Modeler as of Mendix 8.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
"Studio Pro" can be used where regular repetition is necessary in a doc. However, where possible, "Mendix" should be added to the product name.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Studios

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Where you are describing a feature applicable to both Mendix Studio and Studio Pro, use "Mendix Studio and Studio Pro." However, after you introduce the names of both products once and need to refer to them together again, use "the Mendix Studios."
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
When you need to use one general product name in a diagram, it is fine to use just "Studios."
{{% /alert %}}

## Other Mendix Terms

This section contains the main Mendix terms that are used in the product UI and documentation.

### app

An app can be one of the following:

* A local application
* A [Free App](#free-app)
* A licensed application hosted on the Mendix Cloud; another cloud such as AWS, SAP Cloud, or IBM Cloud Portal; or on the user's own server

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use "app" or "application" when referring to apps in general. Do not capitalize (meaning, do not write "Mendix App").
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
The full word "application" has a more well-rounded meaning to it (as in, web and mobile apps), whereas "app" may suggest just mobile apps to the reader. Accordingly, it can be better to use "application" at the beginning of documents and then switch to "app" later on. We want to make it clear that Mendix is not just for building mobile apps, but all kinds of applications.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
It is useful to differentiate "app" from "app project" when referring to what the user works on for project management in the Developer Portal. For more information, see [app project](#app-project).
{{% /alert %}}

### App ID

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Always capitalize.
{{% /alert %}}

### app project {#app-project}

"App" should be used instead of "project" as much as possible in the documentation. However, be aware of potential confusion here when referring to what the user works on for project management in the Developer Portal. A "project" would include the app being developed itself as well as resources from the Developer Portal, deployment, and elsewhere. Thus, "app" as something a Mendix user makes and an end-user uses cannot entirely replace "project" in the documentation.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
"App project" should be used to clarify project management-related tasks in the Developer Portal.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="success" %}}
Enter the email addresses of all the co-workers you want to invite to your app project.
{{% /alert %}}

### App Team

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize, because **Team** is capitalized in the Developer Portal.
{{% /alert %}}

### App User

The app end-users invited to use your app while it is still being built.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### AppCloud

This appears in some Mendix Cloud and Developer Portal documentation. It continues in the name of the [AppCloudServices](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/934/) module, which provides single sign-on (the original idea of AppCloud can be found in this [press release](https://www.mendix.com/press/new-mendix-appcloud/)).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use. Use specific SSO-related terminology instead.
{{% /alert %}}

### Atlas UI {#atlas-ui}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use just "Atlas."
{{% /alert %}}

### Build Server

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances of the Mendix Build Server (to parallel "Team Server" and "Model Server").
{{% /alert %}}

### Business Engineer

This is an app project role. As such, it differs from the term "business developer," which is used in the [Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/) as a generic role and persona term. Forrester also uses this term.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Buzz

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use "Buzz" on its own, unless you need to specify "Company Buzz" or "App Buzz" for context.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use "the Buzz" (unless the context demands it).
{{% /alert %}}

### Company Admin

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Company Contact

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### delighters

{{% alert type="info" %}}
This term can be used again in customer-facing documentation to refer to certain productivity improvements. There is a **Delighters** section in the Studio Pro release notes.
{{% /alert %}}

### fast deploy, fast deployment

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use "insta-deploy" or "instant redeploy."
{{% /alert %}}

### Free App {#free-app}

A Free App is an app that can be deployed without a license and is therefore free. There are restrictions on the resources available to a Free App, and a Free App environment is not the same thing as a cloud environment, as it does not support complex or large applications. Free Apps are part of the [Mendix Free Edition](#free-edition).

For more information, see [Sandbox](#sandbox), a deprecated term for a Free App environment.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Free Edition {#free-edition}

This is the package of offerings that users can employ without requiring a paid license.

This replaced [Community Edition](#community-edition) in 2015, and was made a focus of the announcements at [Mendix World 2019](https://www.mendix.com/blog/a-3-step-leap-into-your-digital-future-highlights-from-mendix-world/).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use to refer to the whole package of Mendix free offerings (Studio Pro, Studio, and Free Apps), not individual parts of the offering.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### guided product introduction tour

Used to describe the user guidance that is built into Mendix Studio. This is a generic term, so it can be applied as more user guidance is built.

It should be qualified by the context/location. In the case of Studio, the generic term is qualified by the context/location in the [Studio Release Notes](/releasenotes/studio/) like this: "A guided product introduction tour is now shown when you select **Start Your First App** from the **Introduction Tour** category when creating an app in the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/)."

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not capitalize.
{{% /alert %}}

### Make It Native app

Capitalize the name of the app ("Make It Native"), but do not capitalize "app."
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix Assist {#mendix-assist}

This is the official term and replaces "Mx Assistant" and "Mx Assist." These terms are not to be used in the product UI or documentation. For more information, see the [Terminology History](#outdated) section below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix mobile app {#mendix-mobile-app}

[Mendix](/refguide/getting-the-mendix-app) is the name for the mobile app available for developers to test hybrid mobile apps using PhoneGap.

This term replaces "Mendix Developer app" and "Mendix Mobile app." These terms are not to be used in the product UI or documentation. For more information, see the [Terminology History](#outdated) section below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
To avoid confusion with "Mendix" in all its other usages, always use "the Mendix mobile app" and cross-reference [Getting the Mendix Mobile App](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/getting-the-mendix-app) where possible.

### Mendix Runtime {#runtime}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in instances when referring to Runtime as part of the Mendix Platform. The best practice is to use a definite article for additional clarity: "the Mendix Runtime."

When we talk about the physical location of hardware that contains Mendix software, we are referring to a location, or premises. "Premises" means the land and buildings owned by someone, especially by a company or organization.

"Premise" means an idea or theory on which a statement or action is based. For example, "Your claim that you cannot build apps six times faster with Mendix than with traditional development is based on a false premise."

## Terminology History {#outdated}

### Cloud Portal {#cloud-portal}

This is an internal term and should not be used in the documentation or publicly, as it has not been agreed on or branded. It no longer appears in the Mendix Documentation or *Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide*.

Deployment facilities should be described within the name/context of the Mendix Developer Portal (for example, "deployment via the [Developer Portal](#devportal)"). Describing the functionality should avoid using any "portal" language and emphasize the action of "deploying an app to the Mendix Cloud."

### Community Edition {#community-edition}

The Mendix Community Edition was introduced with Mendix 5.18, which included the ability to deploy a Free App. This was replaced by the [Mendix Free Edition (DX Release)](https://www.mendix.com/blog/powering-continuous-innovation-with-the-mendix-free-edition/) in 2015, a move which was reinforced by [announcements at Mendix World 2019](https://www.mendix.com/blog/a-3-step-leap-into-your-digital-future-highlights-from-mendix-world/).
