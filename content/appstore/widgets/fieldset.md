## 1 Introduction

The [Fieldset]() widget is a container to group widgets within a form. Structuring a form helps end users to fill it out, especially when they rely on accessibility tools, like a screen reader. For example, you could use this widget to group input widgets that belong to the same address when a form requires multiple addresses to be filled out.
