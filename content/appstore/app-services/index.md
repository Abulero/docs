## 1 Introduction

The app services available in the Mendix Marketplace are packages of preconfigured business capabilities provided as modules containing logic (microflows and nanoflows), UIs, workflows (activities), connectors, and APIs. As flexible building blocks that include out-of-the-box integration into the Mendix development experience, Mendix app services are designed to solve discrete business problems within the context of larger solutions. 

When you download an app service, it will go into the **App** > **Marketplace modules** folder.
