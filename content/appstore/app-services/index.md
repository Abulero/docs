## 1 Introduction

An app service is a domain-focused and packaged business capability delivered in the form of an API or an API and associated UI. App services are flexible building blocks that include out-of-the-box integration into the Mendix development experience, enabling users to imagie new apps, extend the capability of existing apps, and significantly increase time-to-value.

When you download an app service, it will go into the **Project** > **App Store modules** folder.

App services like [3D Viewer](3d-viewer) start with a free trial for development and testing. After the trial ends, a [subscription](app-store-overview#subscriptions) will be required to continue using the app service.
