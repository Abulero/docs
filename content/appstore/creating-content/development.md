## 1 Introduction

This section of the Solutions Guide provides information and best practices on how to develop Solutions on the Mendix platform that are ready to be sold on the Mendix Marketplace.

While [Mendix Best Practices](/howto/general/dev-best-practices) apply, there are additional considerations when architecting & developing a Mendix Solution. The overview of [Architecting Adaptive Solutions](adaptive-solution-architecture) is a good starting point. Then continue reading how to apply [Intellectual Property Protection](ip-protection) to make your solution ready to sell to customers.
