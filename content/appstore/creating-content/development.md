## 1 Introduction

This section of the Solutions Guide provides information and best practices on how to develop Solutions on the Mendix platform that are ready to be sold on the Mendix Marketplace.

While [Mendix Best Practices](/howto/general/dev-best-practices) apply, there are additional considerations when architecting & developing a Mendix Solution. The overview on how to [architect for adaptation](adaptive-solution-architecture) is a good starting point. Then continue reading on how to apply [IP Protection](ip-protection) to make your solution ready for sales to consumers.
