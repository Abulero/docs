## 2 Applying to the Vendor Program

Whether you are an individual supplier with your own business or you are supplying a component on behalf of your company, you need to [apply](https://www.mendix.com/marketplace-vendor-program/#contactForm) to the Mendix Vendor Program. Since your Mendix Vendor account will be associated with your Mendix ID, make sure you have a [Mendix Platform account](https://signup.mendix.com/). 

When applying to the program, you will be asked for basic information, including your legal name and address. This information is used to check whether you want to sell your content or offer it for free.

| Company Name | The legal name of the entity that will sell or offer your content. |
| Company Address | The legal address of the entity that will sell or offer your content. |

As the owner of the Mendix Vendor account, you must have permission to legally bind your company to Mendix.

## 3 Mendix Vendor License Agreement {#vendor-license}

Whether you are offering a free or paid component through the Marketplace, you need to accept our Mendix Vendor License Agreement, which is an agreement between Mendix and you as a Mendix Vendor within the Mendix Vendor Program.

For ease of reference, here are some of the main points of the license agreement you need to be aware of:

{{% todo %}}[**THESE GENERIC POINTS NEED VERIFICATION**]{{% /todo %}}

* Your content must be free from any known security vulnerabilities
* Your content must not contain default passwords, authorization keys, or any other credentials
* Your content must not include software that collects and exports customer data without the customer's knowledge and express consent
* You must define the applicable laws, treaties, regulations for your content, including, without limitation, those related to export control, data privacy, international communications, and the transmission of technical or personal data
* Your content must be production-ready and must include a defined support policy
* Mendix reserves the right to reject content that does not comply with these guidelines or the requirements described in the license agreement

## 4 Legal & Compliance Checks

The company registered with your account is the legal entity against which Mendix will be bound. For this reason, Mendix performs screening checks to ensure we are legally permitted to undertake business transactions together.

In addition, before your content can be published in the Marketplace, it must be classified for export to the countries in which it will be sold and for how it will be used.
