## 2 Becoming a Mendix Vendor {#vendor}

The [Mendix Vendor Program](https://www.mendix.com/marketplace-vendor-program/) includes opportunities for a variety of types of partners (for example, App Service Vendors, Mendix Solution Vendors, and Startups). This guide focuses on selling app services, but if you are a startup or you want to sell a full Mendix solution, read on to learn more.

Whether you are supplying an app service as an individual with your own business or you are acting on behalf of your organization, you will be in great company by joining the Mendix Vendor Program.  We only need some key information from you before you are ready to offer your product through the Mendix Marketplace. Mendix will work with you throughout the application process to make your submission experience as simple as possible.

## 3 Prerequisites

Before you can create a Mendix Vendor account, there are a few prerequisites to take care of. For paid app services, whether you are an individual supplier with your own business or you are supplying on behalf of your company, you need a [Mendix Platform account](https://signup.mendix.com/) before you can create a Mendix Vendor account.

In addition to defining the business case for your app service (including how it will be licensed, priced, and supported), make sure you meet the export control requirements for your product. We know export control can be confusing, so if you are unclear on what you need to do, contact Mendix at *DIS_AppServices_Supplier_Team@mendix.com*.

Whether you are an individual supplier with your own business or you are supplying an app service on behalf of your company, you need to [apply to the Mendix Vendor Program](https://www.mendix.com/marketplace-vendor-program/#contactForm).

Since your Mendix Vendor account will be associated with your Mendix ID, make sure you have a [Mendix Platform account](https://signup.mendix.com/). 

When applying to the program, you will be asked for basic information, including your legal name and address. This information is used to check whether you want to sell your app service or offer it for free.

## 5 Mendix Vendor License Agreement {#vendor-license}

Whether you are offering a free or paid app service through the Marketplace, you need to accept our Mendix Vendor License Agreement, which is an agreement between Mendix and you as a Mendix Vendor within the Mendix Vendor Program.

For ease of reference, here are some of the main points of the license agreement you need to be aware of:

* App services must be free from any known security vulnerabilities
* App services must not contain default passwords, authorization keys, or any other credentials
* App services must not include software that collects and exports customer data without the customer's knowledge and express consent
* You must define the applicable laws, treaties, regulations for your app service, including, without limitation, those related to export control, data privacy, international communications, and the transmission of technical or personal data
* App services must be production-ready and must include a defined support policy
* Mendix reserves the right to reject app services that do not comply with these guidelines or the requirements described in the license agreement

## 6 Legal & Compliance Checks

The company registered with your account is the legal entity against which Mendix will be bound. For this reason, Mendix performs screening checks to ensure we are legally permitted to undertake business transactions together.

In addition, before your app service can be published in the Marketplace, it must be classified for export to the countries in which it will be sold and for how it will be used. For details, see the [Export Control](#export-control) section below.
