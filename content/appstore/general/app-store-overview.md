## 1 Introduction

The [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/) is a vibrant marketplace containing complete sample apps that can be used right away as well as various components (connectors, widgets, and modules) that can be used to build custom apps more quickly. In the Mendix Marketplace, you can browse all the content, get what you need, and share the content you have created.

This document describes the different sections of the Mendix Marketplace.

## 2 Marketplace Home Page {#home}

The home page is your entry point to the various parts of the Mendix Marketplace. Here you can perform actions such as the following:

* Click **My Marketplace** to go to pages presenting your [Marketplace activity](#my-marketplace) as well as your company's [private content](#company-content)
* Click  **Get Studio Pro** to get the latest version of [Studio Pro](/releasenotes/studio-pro/)
* Click **Add Content** to [share new Marketplace content](/appstore/general/share-app-store-content) you have developed
* Explore various [content categories](#catalog).

![](attachments/app-store-overview/home-page.jpg)

<a name="catalog"></a>The Marketplace offers the following content categories:

| Catalog | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Widgets](/appstore/widgets/) | Widgets are single user-interface elements like containers, drop-down menus, and buttons. Select a widget, configure it, and add it to pages and snippets in your app. |
| [Connectors](/appstore/connectors/) | Connectors are for connecting data services. They have content that you can drag from the [Connector](/refguide/view-menu#connector) pane in Studio Pro into your app.|
| [Modules](/appstore/modules/) | Modules are packages of functionality for your app. They consist of a domain model, security options, and other elements like microflows, pages, or Java actions. Modules are mostly used for complex functionality that needs business or Java logic. |
| **App Services** |  App services are packages of preconfigured capabilities, such as modules containing UI, logic, workflows, connectors, and APIs. They are designed to solve discrete business problems within the context of larger solutions.|
| **App Design** | Start building your app based on a [layout](/refguide/layout) that is ready to use with commons structures and widgets or a [theme](/appstore/themes/) that contains styling options you can apply for different elements and devices. |
| **Solutions** | Solutions are aimed at industries and domain problems. An out-of-the-box solution delivers instant value, and can be adapted using the core Mendix Platform to fully meet your requirements. |

The following filter options are also available:

* **Tags**
* **Ratings**

## 3 Component Details Page {#details}

![](attachments/app-store-overview/component-details.jpg)

The header for each component presents the following details:

* The name and category of the component
* The review average (in stars) and the number of reviews
* The number of times the component has been downloaded

* **Download** – click this to download the component
	* This is only available for components that have a file attached (meaning, all shared Studio Pro components, but not promotions)
	* The best practice is to download a component from the Marketplace that is accessible in Studio Pro, because it then downloads directly into Studio Pro (for details on importing downloaded Marketplace content into Studio Pro, see [How to Import & Export Objects](/howto/integration/importing-and-exporting-objects))

<a name="usage"></a>The **Usage** section presents  the following information (depending on the type of component):

The **Publisher** section presents the name of the company who created the component as well as the **Date** when the component was first published.

The **Developers** section presents the names of the developers who most recently updated the component, with links to their [Mendix Profile](/developerportal/mendix-profile/).

The **Support** section presents the category of support Mendix offers for the component (for more details, see [Marketplace Content Support](app-store-content-support)).

* A **GitHub** link, which will take you to the GitHub source files of the component

### 3.2 Tabs

*  **Overview** – contains the following sections:
	* **Description** – a description of the component
	* **Screenshots** – screenshots of the component

*  **Documentation** – can include details on typical use cases, features and limitations, dependencies, installation and configuration, and frequently asked questions
	* [Platform-supported](app-store-content-support#category) components are documented in the various categories of this *Marketplace Guide*
	* Click **Edit documentation** to open a text editor where you can edit the Marketplace component's documentation
* **Pricing**  – lists the pricing options (only for paid components)
* **Releases** – lists all the versions of the component (any of which can be downloaded by clicking **Download**) along with details like the **Framework version** and the **UUID** (which can be used in the [CreateNewApp operation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/projects-api#createnewapp) in the *Projects API*):

	* For more information on creating a draft version, see the [Updating Existing Marketplace Content](share-app-store-content#updating) section of *How to Share Marketplace Content*

![](attachments/app-store-overview/binding-keys-3.png)

Click **Copy** for each key and manually save the keys somewhere safe, as you will not be able to access them again.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}
Once you close this page of the Service Management dashboard, you will not be able to retrieve the keys again.

To use the binding keys, see the [Using the Binding Keys](#using) section below.

Click **Return to the overview** to go to the main page of the Service Management dashboard. On the main page, you can hover over the **Binding Keys** column to see the binding keys that have already been created as well as to delete a binding key:

![](attachments/app-store-overview/binding-keys-5.png)

{{% alert type="info" %}}
This additional management option is only available for specific app services where necessary.
{{% /alert %}}

### 5.2 Using the Binding Keys {#using}

When you are developing your app, set the app service's **clientID** and **clientSecret** as [constants](/refguide/configuration#constants) in the [App Settings](/refguide/project-settings).
