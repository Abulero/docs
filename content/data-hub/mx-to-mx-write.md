# Mendix-to-Mendix Write
Elizabeth explains that we support OData annotations allowing for creating, updating, and deleting data from one Mendix app to another. Also: insertable correlates to the create part of CRUD.  

## OData contracts
Joost explains that all entities, attributes, and associations exposed in OData contracts are readable. And that additionally:

1. Entities can be updatable, insertable, deletable
2. Attributes and associations can be updatable and insertable

## Catalog
Elizabeth explains that all those annotations are about the data. The Catalog holds metadata. So we'll show you which annotations are available, but the place you can actually change them is in Studio Pro.

## Studio Pro
Paul explains that the CRUD letters visible in the Catalog match what you'll see in the Data Hub pane in Studio Pro. And corresponds to what you'll be able to do with the data when you consume that external entity in your app.
