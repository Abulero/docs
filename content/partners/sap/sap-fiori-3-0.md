## 1 Introduction

SAP Fiori 3 is SAP's target design system used to give your SAP C4/HANA application a consistent look and feel. The [SAP Fiori 3 UI Resources](#wrong) module in the Mendix App Store allows you to apply this look and feel to your Mendix apps running on SAP C4/HANA.

The Mendix module gives you access to designing your pages with SAP Fiori-styled widgets and building blocks, together with support for using integration cards as part of your layout. You can also allow end-users to select a theme and apply it immediately.

You can experience the SAP Fiori 3 design by using the [SAP Fiori 3 Starter App](#wrong) as the basis for a new app, or by including the [SAP Fiori 3 UI Resources](#wrong) module in your app.

More information on using SAP Fiori 3 design in your Mendix app is available in the following sections:
