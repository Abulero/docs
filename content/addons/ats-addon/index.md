## 1 Introduction

The Mendix Application Test Suite (ATS) is a suite of tools for embedding (automated) testing into your application life cycle. These tools are built by [Mansystems](https://www.mansystems.com/) in Mendix on top of Selenium.

ATS provides a powerful solution for automation of not only your functional and regression tests, but also non-functional tests like availability, security, and performance testing. Furthermore, with functions like test case recording and data-driven testing, it provides you with everything you need to make testing your Mendix apps quick, easy, and versatile.

A small investment in setting up ATS, which is very easy to learn, will save you a lot of (re)testing time in the long run. This will help your team and its stakeholders to have the right insights into the quality off your apps at any time and at the press of a button.
