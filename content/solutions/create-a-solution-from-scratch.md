## 1 Getting started

Essentially, Mendix Solutions are like any other Mendix App - with the addition that thereâ€™s been a lot of attention spend on the general fitness of the solution to the needs of larger groups of customers. This means that general Mendix development principles & best practices apply - see below for useful links. And this also means: you can get started right away, from any template available on the Mendix Platform.
