## 1 Getting Started

Essentially, Mendix Solutions are like any other Mendix App - with the addition that thereâ€™s been a lot of attention spent on the general fitness of the solution for the needs of larger groups of customers. This means that general Mendix development principles and best practices apply - see below for useful links. This also means you can get started right away, from any template available on the Mendix Platform.
