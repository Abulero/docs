## 1 Introduction 

To make sure that your app is always consistent and properly built, the Desktop Modeler does consistency checks when you build your app. When a consistency check is not met, the Desktop Modeler will notify you about this via consistency errors on the **Errors** tab.

Errors need to be solved before your app can be published. A consistency error can occur in the following editors or functionalities of the modeler:

* Pages 
* Navigation 
* Microflows
* Domain Models
* Integration
* Security
