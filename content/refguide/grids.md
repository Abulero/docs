## 1 Introduction

Grids show a list of objects and include a [data grid](data-grid) and a [template grid](template-grid). The main difference between these grids is the way the list of objects is displayed: a data grid shows it in columns, while a template grid shows it in tiles. 

Grids have the following components in common:

* [Search bar](search-bar) –  allows end-users to search for objects in the grid 
* [Sort bar](sort-bar) –  allows end-users to sort items in the grid 
* [Control bar](control-bar) –  allows end-users to control the objects displayed in the grid by means of buttons 

## 2 Choosing a Grid

Choosing which grid to use, to display data on a page, doesn't have to be difficult. A few things to consider are:

* What sort of data do you want to display?
* How do you want the data to be presented?

Do you want to display data as a table? With lots of rows and columns? Is the data simple text? Then data grid is likely the best choice.

Do you want tiles or other widgets displayed with each list item? If you want to show an image, add a button, or want to make a custom layout for your items, then template grid is the better choice.
