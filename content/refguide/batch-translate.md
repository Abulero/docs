## 1 Introduction

## OLD INTRO - USE AS REQUIRED

Studio Pro makes it easy to translate your application into another language. You can add a language in the [Project Settings](project-settings) and then switch to that language by 

For texts that have not been translated yet, the text in the default language is shown between angle brackets. For example, a caption can be shown as `<Name>`. This means that the caption has not been translated yet and was `Name` in the default language. By simply typing the text in the currently selected language (for example, `Naam` in Dutch), the caption will be translated.

To ease the translation if you have a lot of texts, a **Batch Translate** feature can be found in the [Language](menus#language) menu. By using this feature you can quickly translate all occurrences of a word to a word in another language. It is even possible to export all texts to Excel and later import the translations again.
