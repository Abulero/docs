### 7.1 Cannot Open Project: `Layout … has an invalid value …`

Very rarely, you may receive a message similar to the one below when opening a project in Mendix Studio Pro 8 which needs to be upgraded from a previous version of Mendix.

![Layouts Error Message](attachments/moving-from-7-to-8/layout-import-message.png)

This happens when a layout has an invalid value for the **Layout type**. This will still cause an error, *even if the invalid layout has been excluded* from the project.

See the image below for an indication of where you might find the error in your project.

To resolve this issue, use the previous version of Mendix to change the invalid **Layout type** (in the example above, `Legacy`) to a valid value.
