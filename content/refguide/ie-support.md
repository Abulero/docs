## Introduction
As the market is moving away from Internet Explorer 11 and to align with the best practices of the modern web ecosystem, we have decided to drop support for Internet Explorer 11 in Mendix 9. This allows us to keep in line with user expectations. Removing support has already improved loading times and performance and will enable us to continue improving this as well as to keep innovating using modern web features.

As of Mendix 9, users still using IE will be shown a message saying that upgrading to a modern browser is required.

This message [can be customized to your needs](/howto/front-end/customize-styling-new##customize-unsupported-browsers).

### What if I still need to support IE11
Mendix 8 and 7 will continue supporting IE11. We suggest using Mendix 8 (or 7) until your users have upgraded. Note that Mendix 8 will still be supported for several years.
