## Introduction
As of Mendix 9, Internet Explorer (IE) is no longer supported. Instead, users still using IE will be shown a message saying that upgrading to a modern browser is required.

### What if I still need to support IE11
Mendix 8 and lower will continue supporting IE11, we suggest using those until your users have upgraded.
