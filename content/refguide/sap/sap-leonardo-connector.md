## 1 Introduction

SAP Leonardo is a toolbox of intelligent technologies, services, and industry expertise. It helps companies rapidly transform into Intelligent Enterprises.

The SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation Connector allows you to use a number of the models which are available in the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning foundation. The connector provides access to pre-trained and customizable models.

The models which are supported by the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation Connector are:

* Classify Image
* Classify Product from Image
* Detect Face
* Detect Topic
* Extract Image Features
* Recognize Optical Character (OCR)
* Score Similarity
* Translate

    5. Use the API key in your app, as described in section [LINK](#api-key)

## 3 Setting up the API Key {#api-key}

The SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation Connector actions are available in your microflows, once you have imported the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation Connector module from the Mendix App Store.

Every call to SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation needs to be authenticated by a valid **API key**. Instructions for obtaining this are in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section above.

The API key needs to be pasted as the value of the constant, **APIKey** which is found in *Project '...' > App Store modules > LeonardoMachineLearning > Constants*.

## 5 Binding SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation Services to Your App

You can use the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning (ML) Foundation Connector to access the services on *SAP API Business Hub*. This is a *sandbox* where you can explore the services in an *"as-simple-as-possible deployment"*. However, to use the full abilities of the services, you need to bind a ML Foundation Service to your app running in SAP Cloud Platform. More information on the distinction is available in the SAP blog post [Production-ready integration of SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation services with an SAP S/4HANA side-by-side extension built with the SAP S/4HANA Cloud SDK](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/07/29/production-ready-integration-of-sap-leonardo-machine-learning-foundation-services-with-an-sap-s4hana-side-by-side-extension-built-with-the-sap-s4hana-cloud-sdk/).
