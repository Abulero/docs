## 1 Introduction

SAP Destination Services enables your Mendix app to use services defined in the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit without needing to know all the technical details of the endpoint.

In particular, it enables you to access services which use a different Identity Provider (IDP) from the one you are using for your Mendix App.

Destination Services will only provide the correct information when run on SAP Cloud Platform. To test your app on your local machine you will have to use a URL to connect directly to an SAP service which is available to you.

## 2 Destination Services Configuration

Your Mendix app will use destinations which are configured as part of your SAP subaccount. From your SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit, you can see which destinations have been configured.

It is not the aim of this document to explain how to configure destinations. For this you need to see the SAP documentation here: [SAP Cloud Platform Connectivity: Destinations](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e4f1d97cbb571014a247d10f9f9a685d.html).
