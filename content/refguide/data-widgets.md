## 1 Introduction

Data widgets display contents of one object or a list of objects. 

The Data widgets category contains the following widgets:

* **[Data view](data-view)** – shows the contents of exactly one object. If, for example, you want to show details of a single customer, you would use a data view for this. 
* **[Data grid](data-grid)** – shows a list of objects in a table format. For example, a data grid can show all the orders a customer has placed. Using controls provided by the data grid you can browse, search, and edit those objects.
* **[Template grid](template-grid)** – shows a list of objects in a tile view. For example, a template grid can show a list of employees with their profile pictures. Using controls provided by the template grid you can browse, search, and manipulate those objects.
* **[List view](list-view)** – shows a list of objects. For example, you can display list of all customers using a list view.
