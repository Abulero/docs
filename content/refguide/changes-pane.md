## 1 Introduction 

For [Team Server](/developerportal/develop/team-server) app projects, this pane shows the local changes to the app project since the last commit. You can commit changes, update to the latest revision, and view the history from here. 

This pane has two levels, so when you zoom into a changed document, you can review all the changes within that document without going back and forth between levels. The zoomed-in level of the pane is split into two grids, with elements on the left and properties on the right. Selecting an element on the left presents the changed properties on the right. To go back to the list of changed documents, click **Back**.
