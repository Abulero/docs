| [![img](attachments/pages/layout-icon.png)Layout](layout) | A [layout](layout) is a frame that your page is placed in. If you change the layout, all pages based on it will inherit this change.  Layout contain predefined elements that ensure unified and consistent look and feel of your application across one platform: the position of the header, size of the logo, position of the menu, etc. For example, in responsive layouts the header can be wide and with a big logo, while in mobile layouts the header will be narrower and the logo will be smaller due to the limited space. |
| [![img](attachments/pages/page-template-icon.png)Page template](page-templates) | A [page template](page-templates) is a basis for your page that predefines its structure. For example, you can create a page template for a customer list that will contain list views with images in it. Thus, every time you need to create a page with similar list on it, you will base it on this template.    By mapping out common design patterns, a lot of the initial work involved in creating a new page can be simplified by setting up a proper set of page templates. |
| [![img](attachments/pages/snippet-icon.png)Snippet](snippet) | A [snippet](snippet) defines reusable interface parts. They can be used on pages and layouts. By using snippets, you will make changes in fewer places if you want to modify the interface. For example, you can have a snippet that is used both in the contents area of a template grid and in a data view. If you add a row to a table in the snippet, that change will show up in both places. |
| [![img](attachments/pages/building-block-icon.png)Building block](building-block) | A [building block](building-block) is pre-styled set of widgets. Building blocks will automatically appear in the page editor toolbox, allowing for easy reuse. By designing a comprehensive library of building blocks, a great deal of the fussy work involved in page design can be averted. |
| [![img](attachments/pages/page-icon.png)Page](page) | A [page](page) is the end-user interface of a Mendix application. Pages are the things that are actually shown to the end-user. |
| [![img](attachments/pages/menu-icon.png)Menu](menu) | A [menu](menu) defines a menu structure that can be used by a menu widget. |
| ![img](attachments/pages/image-collection-icon.png)Image collection | An image collection is a page resource where you need to place custom images to use them in your application. For more information, see [Images](images). |
