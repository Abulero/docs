## 2 Studio Pro Functionality

Studio Pro allows you to create apps, test, and run them. 

### 2.1 Modeling 

Modeling an app is a process of creating an app and involves creating pages, adding logic, configuring security, etc. For more information on what functionality you can use to model your app, see [App Modeling](modeling).  

### 2.2 Testing 

When it comes to testing your application, you first need to decide what you are going to test: integration with external services, app logic (microflows), etc. For more information on how to test your application, see [Testing](/howto/testing). 

### 2.3 Deploying 

Studio Pro allows you to run and view your app locally or in the default environment. 

For more information on deploying your app and versioning it, see  the [Versioning a Project Deployed to the Cloud](using-version-control-in-studio-pro#versioning-project) section in *Using Version Control in Studio Pro*.
