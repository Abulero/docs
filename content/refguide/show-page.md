### 3.1 Input Section

{{% alert type="info" %}}
See [Common Properties](microflow-element-common-properties) for properties that all microflow activities share (for example, caption). This page only describes the properties specific to the action.
{{% /alert %}}

#### 3.1.1 Object to Pass {#object-to-pass}

Object that will be passed to the opened page. This object will be used by [data views](data-view) with a page parameter data source.

### 3.2 Action Section

#### 3.2.1 Page

The [page](page) that is displayed to an end-user. If the [Object to pass](#object-to-pass) is specified, the page must contain a data view connected to the same entity as the passed object (or its generalization).

{{% alert type="info" %}}

You can generate a new page to show by clicking 'Select...' and then 'New'. If you have selected an Object to pass Studio Pro will automatically generate a data view to edit that object.

{{% /alert %}}

#### 3.2.2 Page Title

By default the title of the page is determined by the page title property of the page. You can replace this title with a custom title if necessary.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

This feature allows you to re-use the same page for the **New** and [Edit]() buttons of a data grid. By simply setting the titles to, for example, *New Customer* and *Edit Customer*, you can save yourself the trouble of duplicating pages.
