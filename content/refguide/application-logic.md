## 1 Introduction

While you can create a simple Mendix app using widgets on pages, you can unleash the power of Mendix by adding application logic to your app.

Application logic in Mendix can be implemented via microflows, nanoflows, and workflows. You can change a value based on a function or combination of functions using expressions. 

Explore the documentation for details on microflow, nanoflow, and workflow definitions, properties, and usages.
