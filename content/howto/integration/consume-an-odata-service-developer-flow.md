## 1 Introduction

Developers can consume OData services by specifying the service metadata URL in the Consume OData Service document by.  The entities exposed in the service will be listed in  the Data Hub Project pane and can be dragged into the domain model in the same way as when using the Data Hub pane.  

Developers who are publshing OData services can follow the steps in this how-to to test their published OData service locally before deploying them and registering  them in the Data Hub Catlog. 

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Specify the published OData service using the service metadata URL.
* Use the **Data Hub Project** pane to view and use exposed entities in your app development

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to you will need the following:

* Be familiar with app modelling using [external entities](/refguide/external-entities)

* URL of a valid published OData v3 or v4?? metadata contract

	{{% alert type="info" %}}The OData metadata contract is the `$metadata` file and in Studio Pro the URL is displayed under the **Settings** tab of the **Published OData Service** document:
	
![published Odata service URL](attachments/consume-an-odata-service/metadata-contract-url.png)  
  {{% /alert %}}
  
  {{% alert type="info" %}}You can create a simple published OData service by following the steps in [Section 3 Creating an App](/data-hub/share-data/index#createapp) and [Section 4 Publishing to the Data Hub Catalog](/data-hub/share-data/index#publishing) of the Data Hub how-to [Share Data Between Apps](/data-hub/share-data/index).
