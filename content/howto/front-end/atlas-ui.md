## 1 Introduction

Mendix offers Atlas UI, a cross-platform UI framework that gives teams the foundation they need to build engaging, high-quality experiences and brings UX, IT, and business together. See [atlas.mendix.com](https://atlas.mendix.com/) for more information about Atlas.

Atlas comes with a default design system which can be fully tailored and extended. New apps are based on this design system. The default design system can be found [here](todo:insert)

The styling of apps can be fully customized. For progressive and web apps SASS (SCSS) is used and for native mobile apps JavaScript is used. For more information about styling apps, see [Customize Styling]((TODO:insertlink).

If you are migrating from Atlas 2 to Atlas 3, see [How to Migrate from Atlas 2 to Atlas 3](/refguide/moving-from-atlas-2-to-3).
