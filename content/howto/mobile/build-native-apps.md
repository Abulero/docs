These step-by-step guides will teach you to build native mobile applications and more:

- [Deploy Your First Mendix Native Mobile App](deploying-native-app) – Go from a blank slate to an app running on a device.
- [Build Native Mobile Apps with Parallels](using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac) – Start making Mendix native mobile apps on your Mac.
- [Build a Mendix Native App Locally](native-build-locally) – When you cannot use App Center to build your app, follow this guide to build your apps locally without an internet connection.
- [Debug Native Mobile Apps (Advanced)](native-debug) – Debug native mobile app projects using the Make It Native app.
- [Create a Custom Developer App](how-to-devapps) – Create a custom developer app: a substitute for the Make It Native app which accommodates custom dependencies such as native widgets or fonts.

**Deprecated CLI how-tos**

The Mendix Native Mobile Builder flow replaces the CLI flow. If you use the Mendix Native Mobile Builder with a project, do not use the CLI anymore. 

- [Deploy Your First Mendix Native Mobile App with the depreacted CLI](deploying-native-app-cli) – Go from a blank slate to an app running on a device.
- [Create a Custom Developer App with the deprecated CLI](how-to-devapps-cli) – Create a custom developer app: a substitute for the Make It Native app which accommodates custom dependencies such as native widgets or fonts.
