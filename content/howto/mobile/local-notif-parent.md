description: Tutorials for setting up local push notifications which do not use an internet connection.
---

These how-to's will teach you to build local notifications for native applications. Local notifications will only allow you to schedule and send notifications confined to one mobile device. These notifications do not use an internet connection. One use of a local notification might be an alarm app which sends a notification after an amount of time has elapsed.

**These how-to's will teach you how to do the following:**

* [Use Local Notifications: Part 1](native-local-notifications) — Introduce the native notification module to a Mendix project, configure your notification permissions, and test the notifications on a device
* [Use Local Notifications: Part 2 (Badges)](local-notif-badges) — Make your notifications leave badge indicators on your application's icon
* [Use Local Notifications: Part 3 (Actions)](local-notif-action) — Configure notifications to do an action after being tapped (in this case, show a page)
* [Use Local Notifications: Part 4 (Data)](local-notif-data) — Enable notifications to pass data and thus bring a user to a page with specific parameters set
* [Use Local Notifications: Part 5 (Scheduling)](local-notif-schedule-cancel) — Make notifications trigger at a certain time, and cancel them
