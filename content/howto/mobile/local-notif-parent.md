## 1 Introduction

These how-to's will teach you to build local notifications for native applications. Local notifications will only allow you to schedule and send notifications confined to one mobile device. These notifications do not use an internet connection. One use of a local notification might be an alarm app which sends a notification after an amount of time has elapsed.

**These how-to's will teach you how to do the following:**

* [Set Up Local Notifications](native-local-notifications) — Introduce the native notification module to a Mendix project, configure your notification permissions, and test the notifications on a device
* [Set Up Badges](local-notif-badges) — Make your notifications leave badge indicators on your application's icon
* [Set Actions for Tapped Notifications](local-notif-action) — Configure notifications to do an action after being tapped (in this case, show a page)
* [Send Data with Notifications](local-notif-data) — Enable notifications to pass data and thus bring a user to a page with specific parameters set
* [Schedule and Cancel Notifications](local-notif-schedule-cancel) — Make notifications trigger at a certain time, and cancel them
