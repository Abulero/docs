## 9.6.0 {#960}

**Release date: September 28th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "9.6.0" %}}

### New Features

* We have made the **Change workflow state** microflow activity available, which allows you to add, abort, restart, continue, pause, and resume actions for a [workflow](/refguide/workflows) and control workflow instances.

#### Updated Studio Pro Look & Feel

We are continuously improving your Studio Pro experience, and we made a big step with version [9.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.0) to modernize the UI. This release contains further major improvements.

When you start Studio Pro, there is a new UI to make selecting and managing your versions more intuitive and simpler. We also have a redesigned place for your apps.

Next to that, we did a full overhaul of the [Toolbox](/refguide/view-menu#toolbox). Besides the current list view to display widgets, microflow actions, and other items, there is now a tile view which shows larger icons. This makes it easier to recognize the actions and for more consistency with [Mendix Studio](/studio/). Also, for building blocks, the tile view will show a preview of the building block, which gives a better impression of it. In your **Toolbox**, you can easily switch between the list view and the tile view based on your preference.

Finally, we have redesigned the [App Explorer](/refguide/project-explorer) with a new visual hierarchy that will help you find your documents even faster and that provides a modern and consistent look and feel.

### Improvements

* We have improved the speed of garbage collection by up to 100x in some cases. (Ticket 125380)
* We expanded the logging of published OData services on the debug and trace levels so that headers and content are logged as well.
* You can now use the [tab container](/refguide/tab-container) widget inside a [containment or repeatable containment](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types#widgets) pluggable widget.
* You can now drag a microflow from the **App Explorer** into the editor and it will create a new system task automatically.
* We renamed the **Image** and **Image Viewer** core widgets to [Static Image](/refguide/image) and [Dynamic Image](/refguide/image-viewer), respectively.
* We fixed an issue in the runtime of a [publised REST service](/refguide/published-rest-services) where an unparsable header resulted in a "500 internal server" error. It now returns a "400 bad request" error.
* You can now define an error handler microflow for [consumed OData services])(/refguide/consumed-odata-services). When the service returns a failure or does not return a response at all, this microflow decides which message to show the user.
* We now show which services are validated in the [Data Hub pane](/refguide/data-hub-pane). This corresponds to the services that are marked as validated in the [Data Hub Catalog](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/).
* We now have a redesigned tree style that is already active in the **App Explorer**, **Toolbox**, [consumed web service](/refguide/consumed-web-service) page, and general selectors.
* We have revised the widget categories of the **Toolbox**, removing the suffix "widgets" and aligning the naming with Mendix Studio.
* We now execute queued tasks in a context equivalent to the one in which they were created. Executing in the system context is now deprecated, and a one-way project setting has been introduced for this.
* We added the `reload()` method to the [List Values API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-client-apis-list-values#listvalue-reload) to fetch the underlying data source again.
* We now show an icon on microflow and Java action calls when they run in the background.

### Fixes

* <a name="315"></a> We fixed a [known issue](9.3#ki-315) with the exporting of user metrics that resulted in the [User Accounts and Login Sessions](/developerportal/operate/trends-v4#Trends-appmxruntimesessions) graph being empty for apps deployed to the Mendix Cloud.
* We fixed an issue in the Marketplace where the **Show** filter setting was not taken into account when searching. (Ticket 93566)
* We fixed a bug in native mobile where list views with on-click events required two taps to trigger the event when the keyboard was visible. (Ticket 120695)
* We fixed a NullPointerException that occurred when the same project MDA was deployed with reduced permissions in SQL Sserver. (Ticket 122465)
* We removed the option to use the Japanese (Imperial calendar) language in new apps, as it was not supported by our dates library. (Ticket 123609)
* We fixed an issue where opening the edit dialog box for a [cross-module association](/refguide/associations#creating) threw an error when one of the associated entities was deleted. (Ticket 127847)
* We fixed an issue that occurred on a reference selector that used a microflow for the selectable objects and contained an explicit parameter mapping to a page variable. (Ticket 128047)
* We fixed the failing synchronization that occurred when a one-to-one or many-to-one association was renamed to an existing association that was removed. (Ticket 128052)
* We fixed an issue where calling a microflow failed if `$currentUser/System.owner` was used in an expression. (Tickets 128550, 128870)
* We fixed an issue where a list view widget did not update the listening widgets when the item selection changed through key presses. (Ticket 129128)
* We fixed an issue in the JSON exporter where a "null" string was exported as a JSON null value. (Ticket 129742)
* We fixed an issue where a user could not commit because of a security error. (Ticket 129493, 129605, 129902)
* We fixed an issue where the [Call microflow](/refguide/call-microflow) task in the workflow editor lost values when a new parameter was added to the underlying microflow.
* We fixed an issue where a role-based conditional visibility was ignored for the tabs of the [tab container](/refguide/tab-container) widget in native apps.
* We fixed an issue where adding an association to an external entity from the **Association** tab of that entity gave an error message.
* We fixed an issue where [MxAssist Logic Bot](/refguide/mx-assist-studio-pro) displayed slightly stale recommendations if calls to a microflow were recently added or removed from another microflow.
* We fixed an issue in the MXP006 [MxAssist Performance Bot](/refguide/mx-assist-performance-bot) recommendation to convert a microflow to a nanoflow in which the microflow being converted *directly* used a variable that was not available when converted to a nanoflow.
* We fixed a crash that occurred when opening an uninitialized app from the [Most Recent](/developerportal/#my-apps) apps list.
* We fixed an issue with range validations in which a bound was based on an attribute. If either the attribute or the range bound attribute was of type Decimal and the other was of a different numeric type, the validation always failed.

### Deprecations

* We will drop support for [PostgreSQL 9.6](/refguide/system-requirements#databases) after Studio Pro version 9.8. The exact date will be coordinated with migration of our [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy) environment to a newer version of PostgreSQL.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.
* In the **Properties** pane, you cannot copy, paste, or delete using keyboard shortcuts.
	* Workaround: Perform the same operation using your mouse and the context menu.
* It is not possible to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch between open tabs unless you have already selected a tab.
	* Workaround: Select a tab with your mouse and then use the key combination.
