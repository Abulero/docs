## 1 Introduction

Mendix publishes security advisories by leveraging [Siemens ProductCERT](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html), which is a dedicated team of seasoned security experts that manages the receipt, investigation, internal coordination, and public reporting of security issues related to Siemens products, solutions, and services.

Mendix adds the CVSS score and CVSS vector for security vulnerabilities described in the Studio Pro release notes. Mendix also adds the CVE IDs when they become available.
