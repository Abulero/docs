### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.
* In the **Properties** pane, you cannot copy, paste, or delete using keyboard shortcuts.
	* Workaround: Perform the same operation using your mouse and the context menu.
* It is not possible to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch between open tabs unless you have already selected a tab.
	* Workaround: Select a tab with your mouse and then use the key combination.
