## Android 1.1.0 / iOS 1.1.0

With this release we introduce tablet support. Now you can run and test your Mendix application using the Make It Native app on tablets. 

In addition device orientation is now fully supported. Now you can test your apps in any device orientation.

We also improved on loading performance by optimizing the bundle size when "Dev Mode" is disabled. This is just one of many solutions under development to improve the loading perfomance and stability of the app.

## Android 1.0.0 / iOS 1.0.2

**Release date: August 1st, 2019**

This is the official release of the Android and iOS versions of the Make It Native app, with support for Mendix Studio Pro 8.0. Both Android and iOS versions allow you to preview and debug your locally running native app project on any supported mobile platform.

The apps are not backwards compatible with the Mendix Studio Pro 8.0.0 Beta versions of Mendix Studio Pro. For more information on Mendix Studio Pro 8.0, see the [8.0.0 Release Notes](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.0).
