## Android 1.0.0 / iOS 1.0.2

**Release date: July 31st, 2019**

Official release of the Make It Native apps, with support for Mendix Studio Pro 8.0. The apps are not backwards compatible with the beta releases of Mendix Studio Pro.

### Limitations:

* Clearing data on Android via the start screen does not clear cookies correctly. Using the developer menu option does clear cookies.

## Android 1.0 / iOS 1.0

**Release date: June 21st, 2019**

Both Android and iOS versions allow you to preview and debug your locally running native app project on any supported mobile platform. 

The iOS version contains the following extra features to help new users (which will be available for Android in the future):

* We developed a slideshow which explains the appâ€™s most common features (accessed via the **?** button in the top-right corner).
* We added **Showcase**, a page which lets you view some of Mendix's core and pluggable widgets as well as their Atlas UI styling.
* We enabled access to Mendix documentation directly from the app (accessed via the **?** button in the top-right corner).
