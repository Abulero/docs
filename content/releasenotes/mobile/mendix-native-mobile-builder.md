The Mendix Native Mobile Builder is a UI-based tool, complimentary to Mendix Studio Pro, which helps you build your Mendix native mobile app. After the Mendix Native Mobile Builder simplifies your build process, you can do what you want most: test and publish your app. The Mendix Native Mobile Builder uses MxBuild, GitHub, and App Center to simplify the app building process and is directly accessible via Mendix Studio Pro. 

# 1.0.49

**Release date: October 27th, 2020**

#### Features

With a few clicks you can:

#### Background Updates

Mendix Native Mobile Builder supports background updates. That means it needs to be installed once and it will update itself as soon as there is a newer version.
This auto update functionality allows us to push a new version as soon as the newest and greatest features are ready to be shipped.
