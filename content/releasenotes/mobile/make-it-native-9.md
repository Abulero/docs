## Android 1.0.5

**Release date: 11 May 2021**

### Improvements

AR specific device features should once again be not mandatory. We added a dialog notifying users' of unsupported devices that AR might not fully work on the specific device.
Devices that do not comply with the AR requirements will once again be able to download the Make It Native 9 from the Google play store, but Mendix 9 AR features might not be fully testable.


## Android 1.0.4 / iOS 1.0.2

**Release date: 30th March 2021**

This is the official release of the Android and iOS versions of the Make It Native 9 app, with support for Mendix Studio Pro 9.0. Both Android and iOS versions allow you to preview and debug your locally running native app project on any supported mobile platform.
