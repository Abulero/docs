The Native Builder takes your Mendix project containing a native profile and packages a native app for iOS and Android. More specifically, Native Builder uses MxBuild, GitHub, and App Center to build your apps. For more information on using the Native Builder, see [How to Package Native Apps using Native Builder](/howto/mobile/native-builder).
