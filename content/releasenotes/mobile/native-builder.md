The [Native Builder](/howto/mobile/native-builder) is a command line input tool which helps you build your Mendix native app. After the Native Builder simplifies your build process, you can do what you want most: test and publish your app. The Native Builder uses MxBuild, GitHub, and App Center to simplify the app building process. 

We are heavily invested in streamlining the experience of building your apps and are continuously improving upon the tool's capabilities. For more information on using the Native Builder, see [How to Package Native Apps using Native Builder](/howto/mobile/native-builder).
