## 2020

### October 26th, 2020

#### Buildpack

* We resolved an issue where HTTP headers were only returned for a successful request. You will have to redeploy your app to apply this fix. (Tickets 94915 and 107140). See [Mendix Buildpack Releases](https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack/releases) on *GitHub* for more information.

### November 26th, 2019

#### IBM Cloud Portal Deployment

* We have updated the process for deploying to IBM Cloud Portal (for details on the new process, see [IBM Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/ibm-cloud)).
* We have also added the ability to manage IBM Cloud Portal Cloud Foundry Marketplace services from within the Mendix Developer Portal.

### October 29th, 2018

#### IBM Cloud Portal Deployment

* Deploying to IBM Cloud is available from within Mendix. If you start with an app template, you will be taken through the process of creating a deployment environment on IBM Cloud. You can then deploy your app to IBM Cloud from within the Desktop Modeler or Mendix Developer Portal. More information is available in [IBM Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/ibm-cloud). You can also find Mendix Starter Kits on IBM Cloud and start the process from there.
