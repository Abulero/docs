On this page, you will find a collection of links to documentation about the Mendix Metamodel, as well as external resources you can use as a reference for programming with the Mendix SDK.

## Metamodel

Start learning how the metamodel works by reading Understanding the metamodel. Continue with Projects to learn how the metamodel handles projects in relation to modules and documents. Continue with learning how a domain model works with all its components (attributes, access rules, etc.). The Microflow page describes in detail how you can create and invoke microflows.
