Scout has not been updated for Windows 10 and therefor Windows 10 users need to use the following workaround:

*   You need a 32bit Java 7 runtime. You may use [http://ninite.com/air-java7](http://ninite.com/air-java7) to get the right version or download it yourself
*   Windows needs to run in English using the settings panel to make US English default. Note that this changes your desktop language!
*   A rather well hidden option should be used to set the language for non-Unicode programs to US English. Use the search task bar icon to find the control panel and open it. Then select region, administrative tab. The language for non-Unicode programs must be set to US English.

You can set your regional settings back to Dutch and it should still work.
