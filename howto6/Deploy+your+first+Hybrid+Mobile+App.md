## 1 Introduction

Mendix supports mobile web development, and it is also possible to create and publish hybrid mobile apps. A hybrid app gives you the best of both worlds: it's a web application that can be deployed using the Mendix platform, but it runs inside a container that can be installed as a native app on your device. This container handles native capabilities like the camera and GPS, and it can even be published in the Apple App Store, Google Play, and Windows Phone Store.The big advantage of a hybrid mobile app is that you only need to go through the approval process once and every future update is just a new deployment of your app in the Mendix cloud.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Open a hybrid example app
* Install the app on your device

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Version 5.10 or higher of the Mendix Modeler (available from the [App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/modelers)
* The Mendix Developer App, which makes it easy to see a hybrid application in action without the need to get it approved in the App Store (for details and download links, see [Getting the Mendix Developer App](/refguide6/Getting+the+Mendix+Developer+App) in the Mendix Reference Guide)

## 3 Opening a Hybrid Example App

1.  Go to the [Company Expenses](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/240/Mendix/Company-Expenses) app in the Mendix App Store and click **Open in Modeler**:

## 4 Installing the App on Your Device

If you want to install this application as a native app on your device, you can install it via iTunes or publish it to one of the mobile app stores.
