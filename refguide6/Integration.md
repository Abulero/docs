Integration with other applications (other than Mendix) can be done using REST or SOAP/Web Services. Mendix can import and export data from XML and JSON.

Integration between Mendix applications is done best with App Services (see [Published App Services](Published+App+Services) and [Consumed App Services](Consumed+App+Services) ). Some of the most often used terms are explained below.
