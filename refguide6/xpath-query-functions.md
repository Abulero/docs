The following XPath query aggregate functions are available:

*   [avg](/refguide6/xpath-avg)
*   [count](/refguide6/xpath-count)
*   [id](/refguide6/xpath-id)
*   [max](/refguide6/xpath-max)
*   [min](/refguide6/xpath-min)
*   [sum](/refguide6/xpath-sum)

These functions must contain full queries as their arguments. However, the functions _avg, max, min_ and _sum_ must specify a specific column in the query to aggregate.
