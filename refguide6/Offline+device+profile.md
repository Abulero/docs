The offline device profile allows users to continue using their Mendix application even without a working internet connection. The offline device profile can be reached (when enabled) by accessing the application with an offline enabled PhoneGap hybrid application. A number of restrictions apply to pages available to the offline device profile, a full listing can be found [here](Offline).
