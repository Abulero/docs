### Class

The class property allows you to specify a cascading style sheet (CSS) class that applies to the entire document and its contents. This class will be applied in the browser and can affect how a page is rendered. The class should be a class from the project's theme.

<div class="alert alert-info">

Styling is applied in the following order:<br />
<br />
1) the default styling defined by the theme the project uses<br />
2) the `Class` property of the widget<br />
3) the `Style` property of the widget.

</div>

You can see which widgets in a page have styling applied via the class or style property by clicking the <strong>Show styles</strong> button.
