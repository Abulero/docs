### Class

The class property allows you to specify one or more cascading style sheet (CSS) classes for the widget. The classes should be separated by a space. The classes will be applied to the widget in the browser and the widget will get the corresponding styling. The classes should be classes in the theme that is used in the project. It overrules the default styling of the widget.

<div class="alert alert-info">

Styling is applied in the following order:<br />
<br />
1) the default styling defined by the theme the project uses<br />
2) the `Class` property of the widget<br />
3) the `Style` property of the widget.
