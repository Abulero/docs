### Style

The style property allows you to specify additional CSS styling. If a class is also specified, this styling is applied *after* the class.

<div class="alert alert-info">

`background-color:blue;` â€“ this will result in a blue background.

</div>

You can see which widgets in a page have styling applied via the style or class property by clicking the <strong>Show styles</strong> button.
