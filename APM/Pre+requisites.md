The APM Tool (version 1.6.0 and 1.7.0) is available for Mendix 6.2 and above and in java 8.

The APM Tool is added as a module a project and runs inside the App.

For certain features java permissions need to be arranged. Current (August 2016) experience that for a Mendix cloud slot only heapdump permissions are not granted by default and need to be requested from Mendix support if you would like to use that feature. See [here](Java+security+settings).

For impact on sizing see [here](Sizing+impact).
