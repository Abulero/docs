## Startpage

When you login to the ATS as a user you see the _My Projects_ page. If there are no projects on your account yet, you are prompted to create a new Project. For project creation see the ReferenceGuide_Projects page of the documentation.

If you already have active projects you can see directly how many test cases have passed in every project. You can now view a specific project or create a new one.

## Navigation

When opening a project in the ATS you are shown the _Dashboard_ page which gives you an overview over the current project.

## Different User Roles

ATS has a role concept that is applied on two different levels, the application and specific projects. There are two roles of users outside of projects:

**Administrators**

Administrators manage users and manage projects, see ReferenceGuide_Administration for more information

**Users**

Users work in projects, they create and run test cases

On the project level there are the roles of Project Administrator and Test Designer. The difference between the two is, that the Project Administrator can change the project settings and configure Selenium hbs and test applications. See ReferenceGuide_Configuration for mor info.
