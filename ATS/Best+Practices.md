## Best Practices

## Naming Conventions
Always use descriptive names for your actions and parameters, e.g. "Set TextBox value" for an action or "Column Name" for a parameter. This makes it easier to know what your action does, without looking into it.

Some parameter names used by the ATS core library:
 * Widget Name
 * Username
 * Password
 * Caption
 * Column Name
 * Column Value
 * Index
 * Page Title
 * Row/Item
 * Value
