**After completing this how-to you will know:**

*   The definition of a Technical Contact
*   What to expect as a Technical Contact

## 1. Preparation

Before you can be a technical contact, please make sure you have completed the following prerequisites.

*   Register with Mendix to obtain a Mendix ID
*   Sign up with Mendix here: [www.mendix.com/signup](http://www.mendix.com/signup) 

## 2\. What is a technical contact?

The person responsible for the Mendix application on a technical level.

## 3\. Who will be the technical contact?

A Mendix application will always be set up and delivered with a technical contact connected to it. The assignment of the contact takes place when the order is signed. The technical contact requires a _MendixID_ before Mendix can deliver the app. (See section above).

## 4\. What can I expect as a technical contact?

This depends on the type of hosting for your app: On-Premises or Mendix Cloud.

### On-Premises (Mendix app runs on own infrastructure)

Managing licenses (renewals/activation/upgrades):

* Mendix will send license renewal notifications to the technical contact via email.

* If the technical contact would like to expand the license (e.g. more users), they need to contact their Account Executive.

You can create tickets through support.mendix.com for questions, changes and incidents.

### Mendix Cloud

First point of contact for the app:

* You will receive notifications for maintenance from Mendix Support

* You will be able to receive alerts from the Mendix application when problems arise (CPU Load is high/Running out of disk space). You can configure the alerting in the monitoring tab of the node.

* You will be the contact for the business if problems arise (e.g. app is down).

Managing the Mendix application in the MendixCloud ([home.mendix.com](http://home.mendix.com)):

* Deployment of model, stopping/starting the app, monitoring the app, connecting project to node, checking logfiles, managing the access rights of team members, and more.

* The technical contact can also provide access rights for project members so they can also perform the above displayed tasks.

Licenses (renewals/activation/upgrades):

* Mendix is responsible for MendixCloud app renewals.

* If you want to expand the license, you need to contact their Account Executive.

Creating tickets through [https://support.mendix.com](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes and incidents.

## 5. Can we change the technical contact?

Yes, the technical contact can be changed in the MendixCloud

## 6. Can we have more than one technical contact?

Currently itâ€™s not possible to select more than one contact in the Mendix Cloud.

For On-Premises it is possible to select more than one contact. You can do this via licenses.mendix.com.
